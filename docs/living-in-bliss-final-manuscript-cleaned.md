# LIVING IN BLISS

ACHIEVE A BALANCED EXISTENCE OF

BODY, MIND, AND SPIRIT

#### Note to the Reader

This is what I believe:

1. **We are not our bodies, not our feelings or emo-**
    **tions, and not our minds. We are pure conscious**
    **energy.** We have existed for all time, are here now
    in this earthly form, and will continue to exist for all
    time. In the now, our consciousness communicates
    with the information contained in the vast back-
    ground energy that connects everything—universal
    knowledge. It is the vacuum energy described in
    quantum mechanics and perhaps related to the dark
    energy responsible for the expansion of the Universe.
2. **Our genes are not our destiny.** If we control our
    environment, we can control our health and happi-
    ness. Epigenetics and neuroplasticity will take care of
    the rest by changing our bodies and minds.
3. **We are not limited by time and space.** Pure con-
    sciousness is fundamental to the Universe. Matter,
    energy, time, and space are emergent or manifes-
    tations of consciousness rather than the other way around. In keeping with quantum mechanics, we manifest events in the now and the future by being active observers of the Universe of infinite possibilities, thereby collapsing our intentions into reality. Further, we can amplify these intentions with the collective consciousness of a group.

I am not alone in my beliefs. It can easily be argued that
because of the proliferation of knowledge and the ease of
obtaining it, more people are achieving, seeking, and teach-
ing the path to Enlightenment than ever before.
In the end, everyone has their own path to Enlightenment.
Imagine a life where your body vibrates with vitality, your
mind is clear and focused, and your spirit radiates peace and
purpose. Achieving this balance is possible and deeply ful-
filling—it is the essence of living in bliss. Let this book be
your guide. By aligning your thoughts, actions, and inner
essence, you can unlock profound joy, clarity, and resilience.
This journey is your birthright: to thrive in harmony with
your higher self and the world around you and awaken to the
extraordinary potential of a life lived in balance.

### The Need for Change

_Wisdom is knowing I am nothing. Love is knowing I am
everything. And between the two, my life moves._

```
—Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj

#### The Journey Begins

```
From Technologist to Mystic
```
What is bliss? An outside observer might describe my
life as blissful. My wife and I are blessed with three
young daughters. I have a wonderful relationship with
my grown son, and his family has made me a grandfather. I
am healthy and successful in my profession and will probably
live and work well into my hundreds. In short, I have found
my purpose and am living it out.
But if you had known me twenty years ago, you would
never have used the word “bliss” to describe my life. I was
utterly disconnected from my mind, body, and spiritual self,
bound up in a loveless marriage, and estranged from my
son. On top of it all, I weighed well over three hundred fifty
pounds and suffered from severe health issues.

So how did I get here? It took a fundamental change. To
start any journey toward enlightenment or self-betterment,
you have to reach a transformative low. It’s cliche to say, “I’m
at the end of my rope,” but there’s no better illustration. We
all reach the point where we either fall or start climbing back
up. And everyone’s low is different. Mine was just painful
enough to force me into action.
When I was thirty-eight, I was diagnosed with border-
line diabetes. I’ll never forget the moment after I turned
forty when my doctor walked into the room clapping. A lit-
tle startled, I asked, “What’s up?”
“Congratulations, Pete,” she said. “You’ve joined the ranks
of the unhealthy. Here’s your blood pressure medication, your
cholesterol medication, and your blood sugar medications.
You’re officially type-2 diabetic. Keep it up.” Shocked by her
frankness, I didn’t say a word.
“Yes, your paternal grandparents lived into their nineties,
but your maternal grandparents were dead in their sixties
and early seventies. If you keep going this way, you’ll be dead
too soon too.”
As blunt and shocking as this interaction was, it did not
result in the great transformation it could have. It was revela-
tory, but I didn’t truly hit rock bottom until three years later.
I share this interaction to illustrate what the beginning of
transformation looks like. It starts with pain and truth. This
doctor expressed the truth better than I could have. She saw
me for who I was and where I was, and she tried to set me on
the path toward health by making me aware of my condition.
This is what I hope to do for you. Maybe you have already
hit your rock bottom, and you’re looking for a hand to help
you climb the rope. If you haven’t yet decided that change is
necessary, I hope to make your rock bottom a little shallower
than mine was.



I like to believe that we don’t all have to experience
something traumatic or devastating to inspire transforma-
tion. My pain was undoubtedly minor compared to many.
Regardless of how much pain you must face before you turn
toward enlightenment, we all must surrender to the pain and
find enlightenment in that moment. So, as I share a moun-
taintop vision of the bliss possible for everyone, my hope is to
inspire you to surrender to whatever pain you now face and
start your journey toward enlightenment now. Like Robert
Pirsig wrote in his critically acclaimed novel, _Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance_ , “The only Zen you can find on
the tops of mountains is the Zen you bring up there.”

The Awakening: Recognizing the Call to a Higher Purpose

When I finally hit the wall in my forties, I hit it hard. I knew
without a doubt: “I can’t do this any longer.” It was time to
turn my life around, but I needed a goal to reach for. I had
to stop the pain—physical, emotional, and mental—it was
unsustainable. But I couldn’t simply stop everything going
wrong in my life; I had to replace it with something. I needed
to seek some semblance of a “good life.”
On a practical level, these conclusions meant I had to
get healthy. I needed to divorce my now ex-wife for both our
sakes. I needed to build a relationship with my son. I knew
I wanted to remarry, to share my life with someone. I had
no idea who that would be when I made the decision, but I
knew I would remarry. We would have children, and I would
raise those children with my new ideals. If I failed at parent-
ing this time around, at least it would be by my own hand.
Lastly, I was determined to learn what it takes to be happy
and make it an everlasting part of the rest of my life as well
as those lives around me.



We need lofty goals to get anywhere, but I didn’t achieve
these goals by dramatic gestures. You can’t lose a hundred
pounds by not eating for the rest of your life. You take it
little by little, breaking it up into bite-sized chunks. No one
described this better than James Clear in _Atomic Habits._ If
you improve by one percent every day, your growth through-
out the year is astronomical. Change occurs when you build
good habits and break bad ones. Bill Gates is attributed with
saying, “Most people overestimate what they can do in one
year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” I’ll
take that a step further and add that we overestimate what
we can accomplish in a day and underestimate what we can
accomplish in a year.
Once I clarified my plan and decisions, I followed
through— _Atomic Habits_ style, even though Clear wouldn’t
write his book for almost another decade! I was on track to
accomplish everything I set out to do, just as described above.
I was divorced, fit, and starting to put myself out there again.
Could I actually attract love? Can I build a relationship with
my son Peter? Everything was hopeful. Then I found out
this was not the end of the story: everything crashed to the
ground yet again.
By 2015, I had met my wife, and we were about to start
a family. I had decided not to coach any longer to free myself
up to invest in the children. My whole life, coaching, mento-
ring, and motivating others was my joy. I found my identity
in it, and it gave me life. I knew it was right to give it up,
but it was a huge loss. I couldn’t use the coaching mentality
on my wife—that’s not what wives are for! We were one;
our job was to shepherd our children through life together.
I might be able to repurpose my love for mentoring as I
raised my girls, but they were not born yet, much less in need



of motivational guidance. So, this void started to open up
regarding my purpose and direction.
To make matters worse, my company started to strug-
gle financially. In retrospect, this all hit me way harder
than it should have. My life, even then, was still better than
ninety-nine percent of people on the planet. At the time,
though, my world faced an utter breakdown, and it led to
bouts of severe anxiety.
Now, I’m a smart guy. I knew I needed help. So I did some
research and stumbled across Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT). Cognitive refers to the way we think, Behavioral
refers to the actions we take, and, of course, Therapy com-
bines the two and helps us make sense of things. CBT
treatment focuses on identifying and modifying negative
patterns of thought, beliefs, and behaviors that contribute to
emotional distress. The premise of CBT is that our thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors are interconnected and that changing
maladaptive thinking patterns can lead to changes in feelings
and behaviors. David Glaser, a local Licensed Clinical Social
Worker (LCSM) specializing in CBT, was instrumental in
my rebound.
Any therapy is difficult at first. It’s a human tendency to
bury your soul so deep no one can find it, and I was very expe-
rienced with therapists—marriage therapists, at least. After
a few months of sessions, David gave me his diagnosis. “You
have megalomaniac tendencies with an inferiority complex,”
meaning I have an inflated sense of self-importance (ego)
and an obsessive desire for attention and control, as well as
deep-seated insecurities. This inner conflict manifested as
fear of inadequacy, rejection, and failure. My coping mech-
anism is typically an exaggerated display of superiority and
dominance, which acts as a mask to hide my feelings of vul-
nerability and self-doubt. But David kept digging. He asked



simple questions in an infuriating way that cut right through
my hesitancy. Our meetings went something like this:
“What’s the problem, Pete?”
“Well, the company is not doing well.”
“Okay, what would it mean if it keeps going south?”
“If it goes bad, then I’ve disappointed all the people I
work for because they are expecting me to lead them and
survive as a company.”
“And what might happen then?”
“I guess they would all lose their jobs. They’d have to all
go out and find something new. I would too—I’d have to
pick up the pieces and fig-
ure something out.”
“Okay, well, what would
you do then?”
“Oh, I’d probably be
fine. It would be tough, but
I’ve got other things I could pursue. I just know it would be
a huge letdown for my wife.”
David responded incredulously, “Really? Have you ever
asked her? If you lost your job tomorrow, would she really
care about the money you’re not making? Does she care
whether you’re living in a big house or a little shack?”
“No, not at all.”
“Alright, then, what’s the problem?” And this is when he
handed me the Holy Grail. He said, “Pete, don’t make the
events of your life, which you cannot control, your problems.”
There it was: my first spiritual realization. These things
plaguing me were simply the events of my life. Life isn’t
about my mental state; it’s not about my emotional state; it’s
not about my body. There’s something more. I didn’t know
what it was then, but that realization bounced me back.

Pete, don’t make the events of your

```
life, which you cannot control,
your problems.
```


The Rubber Ball

I use the words “bounce back” very intentionally. Around the
time I discovered this new spiritual reality, I realized my life
had followed a specific pattern. Imagine holding a rubber
ball and throwing it up as high as you can. This initial toss
is everything we aspire to do. For me, my first marriage and
early professional aspirations were my first mighty heave
into the sky. For some of us, that ball goes really high as we
achieve great things. But inevitably, gravity will cause it to
crash to the ground.
The episode with my therapist was the first time I hit
bottom. As I’ve shared, the first bounce was the most power-
ful. During that phase, my life was utterly transformed. But
again, what happens each time a rubber ball bounces up? It
falls again. My second bounce happened when I quit coach-
ing and my business suffered.
Here’s the key to it all, though. Even if you feel right
now that you could handle bouncing back forever, you don’t
have to. When a rubber ball bounces, the intervals between
the bounces get shorter. It doesn’t bounce as high each time.
Each time the ball goes up, we know it will come back down,
but hitting the ground will hurt less and less. And yet we are
always moving forward.
Self-improvement is like the rubber ball. Every moment
of growth is that ball flinging into the air, but there will always
be another drop. The important thing is to recognize that it’s
not about the highs and the lows. Both are fleeting. Neither
will last forever, or usually, for very long. Despite my analogy
of throwing a ball in the air, I’ve learned it’s not like that
at all. We have little control over the highs and lows of our
lives. The best we can do is experience the moments for what
they are—temporary moments in time. More important is to



recognize that the ball has always moved forward. No matter
what, there is always progress. Life is forever changing.
What I eventually came to realize at this point in my
life is that it was less like throwing a bouncing ball along
the pavement and more like a cork bobbing on waves in the
ocean—just intermittent swells of peaks and valleys, perpet-
ually moving forward, over which we have no control. When
you know that life is not about its highs and lows but more
about living in the present moment, you will start to realize
you can embrace your existence regardless of your ups and
downs.
There is an infinite sky above you and a near-infinite sea
below you; you are the ripples on the waves of life. What’s
more, there is no true distinction between the ocean and
waves and sky. Everything is one.
We will continue to return to this picture. It was the key
perspective that empowered me to pursue my purpose with
success. When you are no longer concerned with the events
external to you, enlightenment is within reach.
What does this have to
do with the call to a higher
purpose? Many people
believe that life’s purpose
has to do with happi-
ness. When the ball first
dropped for me, pursuing
happiness was part of what
bounced me back. Later, though, I reconsidered the meaning
of happiness.
I was on vacation with some friends, and we were dis-
cussing the core value of purpose. When asked, one friend
explained his purpose was to live a life of happiness. Although
a life of happiness sounds pretty good, I had to debate him

```
Happiness is the surrender of
both good and bad. I am happy
when I understand I don’t need
the good or the bad. Neither
affects me anymore.
```


on it. Happiness—as most people comprehend it—can’t be
a purpose. It’s fleeting. It’s based on circumstance. You can’t
live a life of just happiness because you will constantly be
disappointed by the events of life. Put another way, the ball
is going to bounce.
So, do we have to give up on ever being happy? Thankfully,
no. There is another way to understand happiness. Happiness
is the surrender of both good and bad. I am happy when I
understand I don’t need the good or the bad. Neither affects
me anymore.
I play tennis like a madman. I love the game, but I started
to get frustrated at one point because my skills had pla-
teaued. It felt impossible to get any better. Then, as I talked
with a friend about life, he said something profound: “Living
in this sense of reality is not just about forgetting the bad.
You also have to forget the good because the good can’t be
perpetuated.”
Everything clicked for me. If I hit a bad shot two seconds
ago, I needed to ignore it so it didn’t influence my next one.
If I hit a good shot, I can’t
allow that to influence my
next shot, either. If I did, I
might expect my next shot
to be better than the last
when, in reality, it could
easily be much worse. I now
treat every point of my tennis game as if I had never played
it before and enjoy every second. My abilities don’t plateau
because all that matters is this moment right now.
It’s not about how happy or sad I can be. That perspective
led only to anxiety and my second low. As Buddha taught,
nothing is permanent. We all live in an ever-changing world.
If we surrender the highs and surrender the lows, all we have

moments of greatness, but in the

left is progressing through life, realizing that progression in
itself is wondrous.
David and CBT helped me immeasurably. However,
what I didn’t know at this time was that the internal fears and
self-doubt that led to my anxiety were actually much more
deeply imprinted in me as a result of my genetic makeup, my
upbringing, and the childhood experiences that formed my
prefrontal cortex. But more about that in Part Two.
At this point, however, I realized wisdom is recognizing
the awesomeness, not only in the moments of greatness, but
in the moments of the mundane. That is the secret.

#### The Roadmap for Change

```
Everything Is Connected
```
When we talk about the bouncing ball metaphor, the end
result is the realization that everything—sea, waves,
sky, space, stars, galaxies, the Universe—is all the same.
Everything is made of matter, energy, and information—
the quantum field of potentiality and infinite possibilities, a
field of pure potential that can be influenced by conscious-
ness. I believe the quantum field and pure consciousness
are interconnected and are fundamental to the Universe.
Consciousness plays a role in shaping the quantum field,
making reality as we perceive it.
Nicola Tesla has been credited with saying, “If you want to
find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, fre-
quency, and vibration.” He added, “Throughout space, there is
energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static, our hopes are
in vain; if kinetic—and this we know it is, for certain—then it
is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching
their machinery to the very
wheelwork of nature.” So,
we can surmise that every-
thing must be connected,
but universal connectivity
leads to more questions.
You and I are both
included in that “every-
thingness.” Consciousness
is the seat of our eternal
self and has been called
many things throughout history—God, divinity, the soul, the
formless self, energy being, spiritual self, conscious receiver,
higher self, overself, the observer, Atman, and endless others.
To me, they all describe the same eternal “You.”
The concept that all things are interconnected and pure
consciousness connects the eternal self to this interconnect-
edness is a profound and recurring theme in many religious,
spiritual, and philosophical traditions across civilizations,
from Judaic Mysticism to Ancient Greek and Roman reli-
gions to Australian Aboriginal beliefs. For a short survey of
these religions, scan the QR code below.

This interconnectedness through pure consciousness
forms a central tenet across numerous civilizations, reflecting
humanity’s persistent pursuit of understanding our intrinsic
connection to everything that exists.

The Model of Man: Body-Self, Mind-Body Self,

and Mental Self

If we don’t know what we are dealing with, we can never
control it. We must start with a model of man. Many people
have created models of human existence over the years, with
varying degrees of success and accuracy. Michael Singer’s
framework is quite good, but I’ve amended it into a new,
Comprehensive Model of Man.
We primarily think of our “self ” as our body. We call this
the body-self or the animal self. This self inhabits the phys-
ical plane and primarily interacts with our senses of touch,
sight, sound, smell, and taste. We gather data through the
senses and conceptualize ourselves as having dimension and
interaction as a physical body.
The next level of self is emotional, or what I like to refer
to as the mind-body self. Emotions are closely tied to both
the animal self and the mental self, which we will discuss
further along because we manifest feelings in our physical
body. These feelings are interpreted by the mind and stored
in our memory as experiences. Feelings are energy in motion
channeled through our body’s chakras, or energy centers.
In general, emotion flows from the Root chakra up
through the rest of the body, but the flow can become
blocked due to many factors. We experience feelings through
our bodies, but we also perceive emotion through our con-
sciousness, and the intersection of those experiences forms
the true emotional or mind-body self.



The emotional plane is the range of energy vibrations
above what is normally detectable by the five senses but below
the vibration rate of the mental plane. The Hawkins Energy
Scale, created by Dr. David R. Hawkins and presented in
his book _Power vs. Force_ , ranks human emotions and states
of consciousness on a scale from 0 to 1000. According to
Hawkins, higher frequencies on this scale correspond to
greater levels of consciousness and positivity, while lower
frequencies align with negative emotions or states. However,
despite the intriguing philosophical and experiential insights
it offers, the Hawkins Energy Scale is not widely recognized
or verified within the scientific community. Regardless, the
Hawkins Energy Scale can be a useful tool for personal
growth and reflection on emotional states.
If we take a step higher into the mental plane, we find
our mental self. As you might imagine, the mental self is
complex. A common understanding of the mental versus
physical self is “My body is how I perceive myself, but my
mind is actually me.” While there is a kernel of truth to it,
this is a dramatic oversimplification.
Dandapani, an ex-Hindu priest, aptly describes the mind
as a dark mansion in his book _The Power of Unwavering Focus_.
If you found yourself in this mansion, you would see noth-
ing but long hallways with hundreds and thousands of closed
doors. If you could open a door, you would find that each room
stores certain memories, experiences, or intellectual capacities.
Even if you forced a door open, though, you wouldn’t be able
to see inside. But every once in a while, a great flood light illu-
minates what’s inside the rooms behind the doors.
This light is your conscious awareness and dictates which
rooms are used and how frequently. When something hap-
pens, it might elicit an emotional reaction, but that emotion
actually just sits there in a darkened room until the light of



your awareness focuses on it. Focused concentration is a skill
we can all cultivate through the practice of meditation. Once
mastered, you have utter control over which rooms are illu-
minated in your mind at any given moment.
You have a consciously aware mind—the floodlight in
the mansion—but you also have subconscious and uncon-
scious minds. They are akin to normal house functions such
as heating, cooling, and running water. They happen, and
we know they happen, but we don’t have to actively operate
them to make sure they work.
The other common understanding of how the mind works
is from Sigmund Freud’s theory of personality, which involves
three components: id, ego, and superego. Most have heard
these terms, but the actual meanings tend to get obscured. The
id represents the instinctual desire for pleasure and immediate
gratification. As an example, the id craves the cake and urges
you to eat it right away to satisfy hunger and the pleasure of
taste, without thinking of the consequences like weight gain.
The superego represents our moral values and societal
norms. It counters the id by reminding us that eating the
cake might violate our commitment to staying healthy or
adhering to our diet. It invokes feelings of guilt or shame,
urging us to resist temptation and uphold discipline.
According to Freud, the ego, which mediates between
the id and the superego, tries to find a compromise. It
acknowledges the id’s desire for the cake but also considers
the superego’s demand for self-control. The ego might sug-
gest a middle ground—perhaps allowing a smaller portion of
cake or delaying the indulgence until after you’ve completed
a workout.
However, in my experience, this doesn’t seem exactly
right. American social psychologist and author Jonathan
David Haidt uses a different analogy to describe the ego in



his book _The Happiness Hypothesis_. He compares the mind
to a rider on an elephant, where the elephant represents the
automatic, emotional, and unconscious processes (similar
to Freud’s id), and the rider is the conscious, rational mind
(closer to Freud’s ego).
In this metaphor, the rider (ego) tries to steer the ele-
phant using reason and willpower. However, the rider’s
control is limited because the elephant (representing our
powerful emotions, instincts, and habitual responses) often
drives behavior. While the rider can guide and direct the ele-
phant at times, it can be difficult for the rider to control it
when the elephant has strong desires or instincts.
Haidt suggests that much of our behavior is driven by
this emotional elephant, with the rider rationalizing deci-
sions after the fact rather than truly being in control. The
interplay here illustrates the ego’s role as a reasoning force,
but one that is often less powerful than we believe when
faced with the deep emotional forces of our subconscious.
This view contrasts Freud’s idea of the ego being a
mediator between the id and superego. Haidt emphasizes
the limited control of the rational mind over our emotional
drives, highlighting the importance of understanding and
working with, rather than against, the emotional side of our
psyche to achieve happiness and well-being. Michael Singer
would agree with Haidt as he characterizes ego as the direct
result of the Spiritual Self (consciousness) being under the
delusion of identification with the body, emotions, and
thoughts—the result being “I.”
I lean towards Haidt’s way of thinking. In my personal
experience, my ego tends to want to “make me look good”
and “always be right.” I’ve come to realize my authentic self
sits underneath this ego. We need to train and tame our ele-
phant to achieve this authenticity.



These illustrations provide a framework for how the
mind works, but they do not define _you._ You are only the
observer of these mental processes.
You are not your mind, you are not your body, and you are
not your feelings or emotions. You are far more complex than
any of it. _You_ are pure, conscious energy. You are made of the
same energy as every solid object, every star, and everything
in the Universe.
The notion that human consciousness could be a funda-
mental force in the Universe, potentially tied to concepts like
vacuum energy (the lowest energy state of a quantum field)
or dark energy, ventures into speculative physics, quantum
mechanics, and philosophy. However, some intriguing the-
ories and interpretations hint at consciousness being more
than just an emergent property of biological processes.
There are a number of scientific certainties that could
support consciousness being fundamental to the Universe.
They are all based on the science of quantum mechanics.
In physics alone, there are many, including the Double-Slit
Experiment, which demonstrates the wave-particle duality
of light and matter, and the Quantum Eraser Experiments,
whichdemonstrate how decisions made after a quantum event
can influence earlier outcomes, challenging our understand-
ing of time and causality. Scan the QR code below to read
more about these and other groundbreaking experiments.



Quantum mechanics conditions supporting the possi-
bility of consciousness being more than a byproduct of the
brain permeates many sciences, including biology, chemis-
try, material science, computer science, medicine, astronomy,
cosmology, electronics, environmental science, and even
philosophy.
My favorite, however, is the quantum biological event of
a single cell dividing and organizing into a complex organ-
ism. Life itself. This involves the combination of quantum
mechanics (at the molecular and atomic levels) and classical
biological processes.
At its core, quantum effects influence the molecular inter-
actions and energy transfers that underpin cell division, gene
expression, and protein function. These molecular events
enable cells to divide, differentiate, and organize into a multi-
cellular organism, following biological processes like mitosis,
signaling, and cellular differentiation. While classical biology
explains the overarching structure and organization, quantum
effects may provide deeper insights into how such remarkable
precision and efficiency are achieved at the microscopic level.
In his book _Quantum Body_ , Deepak Chopra, M.D., in
collaboration with physicist Jack Tuszynski, Ph.D., and
endocrinologist Brian Fertig, M.D., delves deeply into the
innovative world of quantum science and shows how unlock-
ing its secrets can revolutionize how we live and age—and,
ultimately, how we can eradicate disease.
Back to energy. Scientists believe that sixty-eight percent
of the Universe is made up of dark energy—something we
have yet to detect or identify. Dark energy is the hypothe-
sized background energy of the Universe. It doesn’t interact
with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, mak-
ing it invisible and detectable only through its effects on the
Universe’s expansion.



I believe that as we advance in the study of this energy
with the aid of AI, we will finally merge ancient wisdom with
modern science and ultimately find ourselves. The spiritual
energy we are composed of may be the same dark energy
that makes up much of the Universe. Throughout history,
it has been called many things—Ki, Qi, Chi, Prana, Inner
Wind, and many more. In fact, vibration is the process by
which energy becomes matter, as Einstein describes in his
famous equation E=mc^2. The First Law of Thermodynamics,
also known as the Law of Energy Conservation **,** states that
energy of any system cannot be created or destroyed, only
changed in form. As such, my belief is that our fundamental
essence has existed for all time. Now, it exists to observe your
mental, emotional, and body self, but when those cease to
exist, the truth is that you will continue as it always has.
Almost every religion has a different term for the idea of
a formless, universal energy, whether it be the superconscious
mind, divinity, the soul, the spiritual self, the higher self, the
over self, the conscious receiver, or something entirely different.
The energy, by any other name, is still you in your purest form.

Interconnectivity of Self Models

These four types of self—body self, emotional self, mental
self, and spiritual self—make up the interconnected mod-
els of man. Next, we need to examine how the spiritual self
interacts with the body self. We can identify eight levels of
interaction measured by heartbeat, breath rate, and average
basal metabolic (ABM) rate:

- Death
- Samadhi



- Deep Sleep
- Light and REM Sleep
- Deep Thought or Flow State
- “Monkey Mind”
- Eating
- Running

Death is another way of describing the state when no
energy remains active in the body. Any conscious energy
once present has left the body and resorted to its original
formless state.
Samadhi is a state of extremely low energy achievable
only through intense control of mind and body. Very prac-
ticed Yogis and other experienced meditators can achieve
this state by concentrating all their energy in the supercon-
scious mind, but the body’s heart rate, breath rate, and ABM
are severely low—barely enough to sustain life. Gamma
brainwaves are often associated with this heightened state
of consciousness, unity with the Universe, and bliss. We will
explore the states of Samadhi much more deeply in Part Three.
The state of Deep Sleep is slightly more active. When we
are sleeping deeply, our ABM rate is very slow, and only the
subconscious mind is active, working with Delta and Theta
waves. But in both Samadhi and Deep Sleep, we observe a
powerful phenomenon. Even though energy is subdued, in
these states, the body self-heals most effectively. We know
this is true from a medical standpoint.
We observe the deep sleep state most often in infants
and small children. If you’ve ever been around a child, they
sleep for ten to twelve hours per night, so soundly you can



barely wake them up. They need deep sleep to grow and
develop, both mentally and physically. The older you get, the
less percentage of your night is spent in deep sleep—instead,
you cycle between light sleep and REM sleep with perhaps
an hour or two of deep sleep.
Light and REM sleep involve a slow ABM rate, but
now the subconscious mind is more active, exerting energy
toward dreams. We see delta and theta brain waves in these
states. Then, in deep thought or flow state, your conscious
mind is active—you know you are conscious—but you are so
completely focused and locked in that your brain function is
practically subconscious.
Next, we have the most common level of brain function:
“monkey mind.” These are your uncontrolled thoughts and
visualizations. Thoughts are even higher vibrations than
emotions. In the “monkey mind” state, there is a constant
chatter of everything going on in your head, you’re frantic,
and your brain pattern is beta waves. We can also look at
eating and running as two further states where the spiritual,
mental, and body selves interact, but these mainly affect the
ABM rate rather than mental function. While eating, the
ABM rate is medium, and while running, the ABM rate is
fast and nearing its upper limit. But these eight states encom-
pass all human energy levels and applications.
There is one final, controversial aspect to understand-
ing interconnectivity, especially regarding our perception of
self. We have both internal thoughts and willful thoughts. I’ll
start by explaining internal thoughts.
Ever since you learned to talk, you have had this voice in
your head—your brain has been talking to you. Your inner
voice has never changed, either. Think back to when you
were little. You’ve always sounded like yourself, right? Your
inner voice never ages and never feels different.



No one can control their internal thoughts. Every voice,
thought, and picture your brain sends you is entirely prede-
termined in your subconscious. You don’t realize they exist
until they hit your consciousness, and you become aware of
what your subconscious is making you think.
Your subconscious and unconscious minds are formed
by your ancestral genetics. Yes, you are influenced heavily
by your parents’ genes, but we can go back way further. The
genetic changes in your ancestral line as far back as we can
go in human history can be found mapped in your DNA.
Now, you do have an executive filter for your thoughts. Your
prefrontal cortex gives you that buffer against the voice your
subconscious sends you straight from your genetic history.
That develops sometime before you turn twenty-five.
But here’s the controversial part: Willful thoughts—the
thoughts you consider to be your free will—are actually still
controlled by your subconscious mind. There is no free will,
at least, not as we typically understand it. We can show this
in an fMRI scan. If I held up an object and asked you what
color it was, you might willfully say, “It’s blue! No, it’s red!
No, it’s blue!” just to show that you have the free will to say
whatever you want.
But the brain imaging would show that your subcon-
scious said blue-red-blue before your mouth and even before
your conscious mind did. Regardless of how you perceive
your thoughts, your subconscious—your elephant—makes
decisions for you, and your consciousness only reflects that
choice.
Understandably, this freaks people out. Who would want
to live in a world without free will? No one likes the thought
of being trapped in an existence as a sort of puppet to the
subconscious. But that isn’t really the point. We might not
have free will, but that doesn’t mean we can’t change.



The brain has a remarkable capacity for change. It’s
called neuroplasticity. This ability allows it to reorganize
and form new neural connections. We can create new neural
pathways in response to new experiences, injuries, and infor-
mation. This means we can adapt and recover in the realm of
cognitive development. By giving ourselves new experiences,
we remap our brains, changing how our subconscious makes
choices.
Now, we know genes are set in stone. Your parents and
your history have established your genetic identity. That can-
not change. However, with recent studies in epigenetics, we
have discovered a capability to change gene expression by
turning genes on or off. Some are controlled by time, some
by environment, and some by you. Our behaviors and men-
tal states can lead to changes at the genetic level through
epigenetic mechanisms. The body “remembers” certain
environmental influences via chemical tags on DNA (e.g.,
methylation), which can turn genes on or off. Internally,
the spiritual you possesses the ability to remap its brain, its
subconscious, and its genetics. We will dive deeper into epi-
genetics and neuroplasticity in the next chapter.
Epigenetics is perhaps why the placebo effect works.
The placebo effect occurs when a person experiences real
physiological or psychological improvements after receiving
a treatment that has no therapeutic value, like a sugar pill.
The belief in the treatment’s efficacy triggers a complex set
of biological responses, including changes in brain activity,
hormone levels, and immune function.
Said another way, something can work for you because
you believe it’s working for you. When people test a new
drug, the placebo effect can vary widely, ranging from twenty
to fifty percent depending on the condition and trial design.
The level of improvement required above placebo depends



on the condition, but in areas like depression and pain, ten
to twenty percent greater efficacy over placebo is often a
benchmark.
So, no, you don’t have free will. Your thoughts and
decisions are predetermined in your subconscious and
unconscious. But we have a more powerful capacity than just
thinking willfully. We can go straight to the source, reshap-
ing ourselves at the subconscious and genetic levels.
If we can control our mind to truly believe what we
believe, we are ultimately powerful. And why wouldn’t we
be? You are your higher self. That energy that is you is the
energy of the Universe. As you learn to harness this power
and establish yourself in your spiritual self, there is nothing
you can’t do for the temporary time you are in your body.

### Balancing Body, Mind, and Spirit

_To keep the body in good health is a duty... otherwise we shall
not be able to keep our mind strong and clear. Peace comes from
within. Do not seek it without._

```
—Buddha
```

#### Healing the Body

The journey to healing begins with a deep desire to trans-
form, which, unfortunately, is often sparked by pain,
illness, or an unfulfilled longing to live more fully. In my
life, the suffering has never been great, but it is always a mat-
ter of degree. The higher the level of suffering, the greater
the chance you either collapse and it destroys you or you find
a bottom and bounce back.
Healing is never just about alleviating discomfort and
returning to neutral. It’s about building vitality, resilience,
and alignment between body, mind, and spirit until you are
living with more creativity, purpose, and joy than ever before.
A healthy body is the foundation it all starts with. At its core,
the quest for physical healing is about rediscovering the
innate wisdom of the body and committing to its care and
growth. I am a big advocate of stating your point up front.
So, here it is. Do more good than bad to your body. Do



more to your body to promote health and longevity than the
bad things we inevitably do. The concept is simple to under-
stand but hard to put into regular practice.
I’ve already discussed
the suffering it took to
get me to the point of
change. At my moment of
self-inspection, when I was
forty-three, my decision
to do something about it
was born.

Commitment, Learning, and Action

Through all my learning, I needed practical answers to one
question: What is the process flow for self-improvement?
The path to healing unfolds through the deliberate flow of
commitment, learning, and action, with each phase offering
critical steps toward transformation.

Commit

My commitment began with a deep acknowledgment of my
need for change. This involved taking a personal inventory to
identify all my unhealthy habits and patterns, whether they
stemmed from physical, mental, or emotional sources.
For me, it was all three. I had poor eating habits and
portion control, a contentment with being identified as a big,
powerful man, and an inferiority complex, leading me to eat
for comfort.
The first time I lost weight, I set specific, achievable goals.
This meant following an Atkins diet for over a year. I dropped

```

```


to a low of 259 pounds and was able to stay around 270 for
most of the next six years, or so. During this time, I didn’t just
improve my diet; I took up tennis and remained physically
active. I had also started meditating periodically to manage
stress, but I didn’t clearly understand what I was doing.
To this point, I never lost enough weight that I ever got
off any medications, which by this time included Metformin
and Trulicity for my diabetes, various blood pressure medi-
cations, and a statin for cholesterol. On top of it all, stressful
events like a failing marriage and the loss of my job triggered
an autoimmune disorder, which manifested as a form of sys-
temic arthritis and psoriasis combined. For that, I was taking
a biologic to reduce inflammation as well as various sexual
performance drugs.
I wish I had made myself more accountable during this
time, either by writing down my intentions or clearly stat-
ing them to loved ones to solidify them as a contract with
myself. I now understand that committing yourself is far
more deliberate than simply making a decision. Where there
is commitment, there is investment and a fundamental alter-
ation of thought patterns. I would love to remind my past
self to cultivate a belief in the body’s innate capacity to heal
and that progress is not about perfection but about consis-
tent effort over time.
After my second marriage to Maureen and the birth
of our first daughter, Emilia, both in 2018, I began to gain
weight once again. By the time COVID struck in 2020, I
weighed 295 pounds.
I caught COVID fairly early on, and while I was never
hospitalized overnight, I did get pneumonia. It scared me
and led me to seek out the services of Princeton Longevity
Center for a comprehensive analysis of my health. I’ll never
forget the dialogue. After what seemed like an interminable



amount of time reviewing my chart, the doctor closed it, laid
it on the table in front of him, looked me dead in the eye, and
said, “Pete, you know there are no fat old people!”
I was floored at his bluntness. He continued, “I don’t
know why you would want to be a fat person, but I see a
history here of gaining and losing weight. If I were you, I
would get weight loss surgery, and I would talk to a psychia-
trist.” By reminding me that weight gain was a product of life
choices, he prompted me to consider my decisions and their
long-term consequences.

Learn

Learning was the next step in the journey. I needed to equip
myself with the knowledge and tools needed for the journey.
The best way to do this is to find the experts. Who are the
masters in the area of self-improvement you have committed
to? Once you identify and learn about them, find out who
taught them.
General Stanley McChrystal counsels that you should
always have a mentor above you, further along in the process,
but also a mentor below you with perhaps less experience but
still plenty of wisdom. It is also essential to have peers who
mentor at your level, as they do the same things you do but
with different strengths.
In any process of self-improvement, you also need an
accountability guide. This person can be one or all of your
mentors, a peer, or anyone you trust enough to be genuine
and honest with one hundred percent of the time.
While I never did see a psychiatrist, I did read and met
doctors to discuss my weight loss surgery options. I engaged
with friends and others who had undergone various bariat-
ric surgeries as well. Besides this, I began identifying trusted



sources of information, such as healthcare professionals,
holistic practitioners, and evidence-based wellness programs.
I diversified my learning by exploring different schools
of thought, including integrative medicine, ancient healing
traditions, and modern technological advances. I read inces-
santly about others who had faced similar health challenges.
I researched various wellness apps, podcasts, and books to
tailor my goals and to gain insights and strategies. In the end,
I was well-equipped to take my next steps.

Do

Transformation takes root in action, where intention meets
implementation. Despite the somewhat dismaying long-term
statistics around bariatric surgery, I decided to have a Sleeve
Gastrectomy. About twenty to twenty-five percent of patients
regain a significant portion of lost weight within five to ten
years, often linked to lifestyle factors, behavioral patterns, or
physiological adaptations.
Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy result in Type 2
diabetes remission in up to sixty to eighty percent of cases ini-
tially, with some decline over time. That said, it remains
the best decision I ever made for my health. My all-time low
was 206 pounds, but a good portion of that resulted from a
loss of lean muscle and fat. I use a smart scale to track my
performance on a regular basis against a series of goals.

```
Description Start Initial Goal 2025
Weight 358 / 295 Lbs. 220 Lbs. 199 Lbs.
Total Body Fat 23.5% 15.0% 14.7%
Visceral Fat 17.5 Lbs. 11 Lbs. 8 Lbs.
```


```

```
* I am actively choosing to stay on Metformin, Testosterone, and a
low-dose statin

By integrating commitment, learning, and action into
your approach, you create a self-sustaining cycle of healthy
improvement. This framework not only enhances your
capacity to heal but also instills resilience, preparing you to
face future challenges with strength and clarity.

Healthspan Versus Lifespan

When you undertake a transformation of your body, all
progress is beneficial. But the next questions you need to ask
yourself pertain to longevity:

- Will these interventions extend my lifespan?
- If I am living longer, what percentage of my years
    will be spent in good health?
- Is there a way for my health habits to improve my
    healthspan indefinitely?

Lifespan refers to the total years one lives, while
healthspan measures the period of life spent in good health.
As we progress into the future with new technologies, heal-
ing will be able to bridge this gap by enhancing both the
length and quality of life.
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned inventor, futurist, and author
known for his groundbreaking work in technology and pre-
dictions about the future of humanity, is known for discussing



the concept of “longevity escape velocity,” which refers to
the idea that advancements in medicine and technology will
eventually allow us to extend human life faster than we age,
effectively halting the aging process over time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) will play an increasingly
significant role in this area, offering innovations like per-
sonalized medicine, early disease detection, robotic precision
in treatments, and real-time behavioral feedback through
wearables. AI is also accelerating longevity research, enabling
breakthroughs in anti-aging and regenerative therapies.
At an Abundance360 conference I attended in 2023,
Hans Keirstead, Ph.D., an internationally known stem cell
expert leading therapy development for cancer, immune dis-
orders, motor neuron diseases, spinal cord injury and retinal
diseases, walked on stage and proudly proclaimed, “Live the
next ten to twenty years as healthfully as you can, and don’t
die of something stupid, because within thirty years, science
and technology will have solved all major diseases, including
aging, which is just another disease.”
In keeping with this theme, at the same conference, David
Sinclair, A.O., Ph.D., a tenured Professor in the Genetics
Department at Harvard Medical School, stated, “There is
no biological limit to human life... of course there isn’t...
it’s ninety-nine percent a software problem.” Nature shows
us that incredible longevity is not a hardware problem: The
bowhead whale may be the longest-lived mammal, with the
ability to reach an age of more than 200 years. Greenland
sharks have the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate,
estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. The human
potential for long life can be maximized with care. The lat-
est evidence suggests that approximately a quarter of the
variation in human lifespan is caused by genetic differences



between individuals. The rest is influenced by epigenetic
and environmental factors.

How to Live Healthy, Longer

Dan Buettner’s study of the world’s Blue Zones—regions
where people live exceptionally long and healthy lives—
offers invaluable insights on how to live healthy, longer. In
his Netflix docuseries _Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones_ ,
Buettner explores regions renowned for their inhabitants’
exceptional longevity and vitality. He highlights ten
practices common to all the locations as the root of their
reputation:

1. Regular physical activity
2. Purpose-driven life
3. Stress-reducing rituals
4. Limiting overeating
5. Whole-food plant-based diets
6. Moderate alcohol intake
7. Participation in a faith-based or spiritual community
8. Emphasis on family and care for elders
9. Like-minded community
10. Strong mental and social activity

These practices emphasize the importance of a life-
style that integrates physical, emotional, and communal
well-being. For more information on the Blue Zones, the



practices that can extend your health span, and the experts in
longevity, scan the QR code below.

I think Dan Sullivan, Co-Founder and President of
Strategic Coach® and the world’s foremost expert on entre-
preneurship in action, says it best: “A key to longevity is
having a future that is bigger than your past.” So much of
my bigger future has come from numbers nine and ten of
Buettner’s list: a strong community. Put yourself out there.
You will live happier and longer.

L ongevity Mindset

A key aspect of my longevity practices is cultivating and
sustaining a Longevity Mindset, heavily inspired by Peter
Diamandis’ books and personal guidance. Many of the con-
cepts in this chapter first appeared in his book, _Longevity_ ,
published in 2023. This mindset stems from a belief in the
power of science to extend our health span by decades.
Adopting a Longevity Mindset means embracing the
role of “CEO of your own health” and shifting your perspec-
tive to see life not as short but as something you can actively
extend and optimize.



Your lifespan and healthspan are influenced by multi-
ple factors: birthplace, genetics, lifestyle choices, and most
importantly, your mindset. Contrary to popular belief, lon-
gevity isn’t predetermined by your genetic inheritance.
In fact, a 2018 study of 54 million individuals found that
genetics account for only about 7 percent of lifespan varia-
tion. Other estimates suggest up to 30 percent, meaning
that lifestyle choices and environment control at least 70
percent of how long and well you live. This puts the power
firmly in your hands to shape your healthspan.
According to Peter Diamandis, there are several key areas
to focus on when cultivating your Longevity Mindset:

1. **Belief**. Your expectations about your lifespan shape
    your actions. Do you see life as short and hope to
    make it to 75 or 80? Or do you aim to live vibrantly
    beyond 100, redefining aging as a manageable, even
    reversible condition? A few years ago, I believed I
    would be lucky to live into my 80s, but with what
    I’ve learned, I fervently believe I will live well into
    my hundreds and be healthfully active right up to
    the end.
2. **Media Consumption.** The information you absorb
    influences your mindset. Are you consuming neg-
    ative or limiting content, or are you engaging with
    resources that inspire longevity? Just like the old
    adage, “you are what you eat,” I believe it’s just as true
    to say, “you are what you read and listen to.”
3. **Community.** The people you surround yourself with
    have an immense impact. Are you part of a support-
    ive, optimistic community that values health and
    longevity? Sharing best practices and encouraging



```
each other can significantly shape your actions. I
am truly blessed to be accepted into so many diverse
yet like-minded communities and groups. Diversity
is indeed the “spice of life.” This is akin to the fact
that my three daughters will, statistically speaking,
live longer because of their genetic diversity—testing
reveals they have no less than eleven different lin-
eages as part of their genetic makeup.
```
4. **Sleep.** Sleep is a cornerstone of health. Aim for
    at least eight hours each night, as experts like Dr.
    Matthew Walker recommended in _Why We Sleep_.
    He recommends a regular bedtime, darkness, cool-
    ness, no caffeine after 12 p.m., no alcohol or sugar
    near bedtime, no food after 7 p.m., having a wind
    down routine, and 300-400 mg of Ashwagandha, 3–4
    g of Glycine, and 1–3 mg of Melatonin if needed.
    Quality rest is not negotiable if you want to optimize
    your healthspan.
5. **Diet.** Your diet profoundly impacts your body. Are
    you eating mindlessly, indulging in sugars and pro-
    cessed foods? Or have you adopted a deliberate,
    healthful diet rich in whole foods, plants, and suffi-
    cient protein to build muscle and support longevity?
6. **Exercise.** Regular exercise, especially strength and
    high-intensity interval training, is critical for increas-
    ing muscle mass and promoting longevity. Evaluate
    your routine—are you sedentary or achieving con-
    sistent activity and strength-building exercises?
    Remember, this doesn’t mean you have to work
    out for hours every day. Per Dan Buettner’s find-
    ings discussed earlier, simply getting up and moving



```
regularly has contributed to the longevity of some of
the oldest people alive.
```
7. **Annual Health Diagnostics.** Don’t leave your health
    to chance. Leverage modern diagnostic technologies
    to detect potential issues early, when they’re easiest
    to address.

Your mindset, particularly having something meaningful
to live for, plays a crucial role in longevity. History offers a
striking example of this principle. Founding Fathers Thomas
Jefferson and John Adams willed themselves to live to see
the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
Both surpassed the average life expectancy of their time,
passing away on the exact date of the anniversary in 1826,
driven by their strong sense of purpose.
Set a bold target for your health span—whether it’s 100,
120, or even more—and program this goal into your mind-
set. Share your aspirations with conviction, inspiring those
around you to think differently about longevity.
Optimism matters. A long-term study published in
_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ found that
optimistic individuals live up to fifteen percent longer than
pessimists. With so many tools and opportunities at your
disposal today, there’s every reason to embrace the potential
for an extended, vibrant life.
Ultimately, the goal is to thrive in every dimension—
body, mind, and spirit—living a life of energy, connection,
and purpose in harmony with the body’s innate potential. We
can move beyond simply adding years to our lives. Instead, we
can focus on adding life to our years—living fully, vibrantly,
and healthily, no matter our age.



If you are curious about more specific practices you can
employ to heal your body, scan the QR code below. I have
compiled some of my research and experiences into action-
able strategies. Your health is your greatest asset. Start today
to take control, reshape your mindset, and unlock the extraor-
dinary possibilities for a longer, healthier future.

#### Healing the Mind

As stated in the first chapter, I began this journey on the
premise that healing the mind started with an under-
standing of happiness. Turns out it’s a lot more. Let me
start with the answer up front again: Fill your mind with
more good thoughts, feelings, and emotions than bad ones,
and that’s the life you will experience. As previously stated,
this is obvious but difficult to put into daily practice.
I wish I could say my journey to mental healing was as
easy as following a preplanned process. Life would be grand
indeed if I could cast a vision for myself that automatically
filtered down to the mundane and fixed everything.
What I can say, however, is that vision helped me to take
stock of where I was. When I hit a low, I looked backward,
up into my life, and reflected on how I got to my current
state. Even just identifying poor decisions in my past helped
me to see what decisions I did not want my future to include.



I built a framework for how I wanted to live. I have since
evolved my original framework to one introduced to me by
Jay Rifenbary in his Blueprint for Character. His five ele-
ments are essential to how I want to be remembered and are
my goals in the transformation of my mind.

1. **Core values.** What do you stand for and believe in
    at the expense of anything and everything else? I
    identified and established my values and will discuss
    them in depth later.
2. **Accountability.** I knew I needed to concentrate
    on reasons for doing things rather than excuses.
    An excuse is when the same—often poor—rea-
    son becomes a habit. It is my choice to determine
    how I behave. I will accept no excuses from anyone,
    especially myself. Your core values can help hold you
    accountable to these declarations.
3. **Personal Honesty.** Needs and fears are the founda-
    tion of decision-making but are also the hardest to
    come to terms with. I forced myself to honestly iden-
    tify what I was afraid to do, compared it to what I
    needed to do, and used that discrepancy as the foun-
    dation for my decisions.
4. **Integrity.** Integrity is the consistency of behavior,
    mindset, systems, and habits, all rooted in a founda-
    tion of morality. The best way to assess that morality
    is to take a look at how you treat another human
    being.
5. **Leadership.** I have always been a leader in one way
    or another, so this one was an easy addition to this
    list. The difficult part is breaking down what it takes



```
to be a good leader. Authenticity in leadership takes
a combination of vulnerability, humility, and trans-
parency, while professionalism in leadership really
just requires emotional intelligence, resilience, and
patience.
```
Your own blueprint can borrow significantly from these
five elements, but feel free to personalize it with the elements
of life you most want to be remembered for.

Mental Well-Being

The well-being of the mind has ties to the other two aspects
of self: body and spirit. The mind is intrinsically linked to the
quantum field just as the body is. We’re always going to cross
back into healing the body and forward to the spirit.
We can start with the superficial portion of healing
the mind, though. Haidt proposes three components to
well-being: physical, psychological, and social.
Physical well-being is enhanced by everything I dis-
cussed in the previous chapter. Exercise, eating right, and
other interventions all contribute to your body’s health.
But any physical concern has immediate crossover into the
mental plane. Mental health issues surround exercise, eating,
community, interpersonal interactions, and anything else you
might imagine.
We’re already well into the second piece: mental
well-being. Just like physical exercise, maintaining mental
capabilities is contingent upon overcoming the tendency
to not use what you have been given. It’s the use it or lose
it principle. For example, muscle fitness deteriorates much
more quickly than you might think. In studies where ath-
letes are confined to bed rest, researchers found that the lack



of physical activity significantly decreases endurance exercise
performance within as little as three days. Another study
shows that the ratio of loss in muscle strength is highest after
only five days.
If you aren’t using it, you are losing it. Luckily, our bod-
ies and minds are resilient, so even if there is some loss in
physical or mental well-being, we can snap back with a little
concentrated effort. Granted, we lose this resilience as we
age, so the younger we are, the more enthusiastically our
bodies snap back.
I recently developed tinnitus, and the persistent ringing has
been intensely annoying. My doctor told me that mild hearing
loss was causing it. The intriguing part about this discovery,
though, is how my brain no longer receives certain signals
from my ears because of the hearing loss, so it then interjects
its own signal to fill the void, which is interpreted as ringing.
My doctor suggested hearing aids, not because my hearing
loss has affected me—I wouldn’t have noticed it without the
side effect of tinnitus—but because if the hearing aids help
my brain receive the missing signal again, it will shut off the
ringing frequency. Sure enough, that is exactly what happened.
Here’s my aha moment: I began researching deafness and
discovered that individuals with moderate to severe hearing
loss have a sixty-one percent higher prevalence of dementia
compared to those with normal hearing. It fits beautifully
into the use it or lose it principle. Hearing and seeing are
both highly energetic mental processes. If your brain is no
longer receiving input from one of those sources, it is no lon-
ger utilizing a large allotment of its capacity. It then loses its
capacity for cognitive ability.
We need to do whatever we can to stay mentally active in
order to keep our brains thriving as we get older. Just like lift-
ing weights enhances our physical well-being, maintaining



good mental health and hygiene is crucial to maintaining
cognitive ability.
The third component of well-being is psychological:
how much happiness is in your life? Jonathan Haidt rep-
resents his Happiness Hypothesis as an equation:

```
H = S + C + V
```
S stands for your happiness set point, C is your living condi-
tions, and V is your voluntary actions.
The set point is our default happiness level, which is
incredibly difficult to change. Living conditions are also
tricky because they are only partially under our control.
Where, when, and to whom you are born all affect your liv-
ing conditions, whether you like it or not. You can adjust
these factors later in life, but it takes great effort.
The one happiness contributor we have uninhibited con-
trol of is our voluntary acts. This is where your strengths or
“superpowers” come into play. Your superpowers are your
instinctive strengths—those things that give you great
happiness because they are easy for you to do. They come
naturally to you. You didn’t have to learn them or train them.
I’m going to add a fourth component: awe.
I like Haidt’s equation, but I would add two factors. The
first is expectation. Mo Gawdat, a previous chief business
officer at Google X, lost a child at one point in his life and
had to bring himself back from the brink. One of his con-
clusions was that our expectations drive us to not be happy.
If we have expectations, fears, ego, or preconceived
notions about what happiness is, then we’re going to be
unhappy because life is unpredictable.
The other component I will add is awe. When we seek
experiences of awe regularly, our happiness quotient soars.



With that in mind, here is my version of the happiness
equation:

```
H = S + C + V + A - E
```
A is awe, and E is expectations. We have control over those
as well as our voluntary acts. Let’s review a few techniques
for eliminating expectations and increasing awe.

Eliminating Expectation

I love a quote attributed to Bruce Lee: “I’m not in this world
to live up to your expectations, and you’re not in this world
to live up to mine.” Expectation is almost synonymous
with the perception of con-
trol. Control, of course, is
an illusion. We don’t have
control over external cir-
cumstances. A good way
to get rid of the perception
is to focus on what we can
control, which is our reaction to external events.
A second technique is to practice radical acceptance and
accept life as an immutable reality. This promotes detach-
ment as you let go of outcomes and focus on effort. The
only way to change reality is through your own struggle. It
also promotes humility as you ask yourself, “How can I give
back?” and “How can I contribute to the greater good in this
situation?”
A third method would be disengaging from social val-
idation. External influences like social media and societal
standards excel at jacking up unhealthy expectations for
what life should be like.

```
With that in mind, here is my
version of the happiness equation:
```
H = S + C + V + A - E



Finally, overcome your fear. Fear is nothing more than
an imagined future or perceived threat. It’s an expectation
of harm that can only undermine your happiness. It also
helps to develop resilience to fear by building confidence in
your ability to adapt. Recognize there have been times where
you’ve overcome fear in your life. Practice reminding yourself
of those moments. Reframe failures and risks as challenges
and opportunities to learn from rather than threats to avoid.
In addition to the above three techniques, I have iden-
tified seven expectations we all have that utterly drain our
peace and joy:

1. Stop expecting everyone to agree with you (stay true
    to your purpose).
2. Stop expecting people to show you more respect
    than you show yourself.
3. Stop expecting everyone to like you.
4. Stop expecting people to perfectly align with your
    idea of who they are.
5. Stop expecting everyone to know or understand
    what you are thinking.
6. Stop expecting seemingly strong people to be perfect.
7. Stop expecting people you know to suddenly change.

All these things will work towards reducing your expec-
tations in general and thus boosting your happiness and
mental well-being.



Awe

In the winter of 2023, freelance writer Ashley Stimpson
wrote an outstanding article titled “Awestruck,” published in
_Johns Hopkins Magazine_. Ever since reading it, I’ve reflected
on my own life and realized the importance of seeking out
little doses of awe every day.
Johns Hopkins researchers are pioneering the study of
awe, a powerful and transformative emotion, by integrating
virtual reality (VR) and psychedelic research. Awe is that
profound sensation we experience when confronted with
something vast and extraordinary—whether a stunning sun-
set, a grand symphony, or the birth of a child. It momentarily
shifts our perception, diminishes our sense of self, and can
even alter our experience of time. Now, scientists are uncov-
ering its measurable effects on mental health and exploring
ways to harness it for therapeutic benefits.
Awe has long been recognized in philosophy and psy-
chology by thinkers like Immanuel Kant, Edmund Burke,
and Charles Darwin. However, until recently, there was no
standardized way to scientifically measure awe. Early studies
simply asked participants if they felt awe, but definitions var-
ied. In response, Johns Hopkins researcher David Yaden and
his team developed the Awe Experience Scale, a thirty-item
questionnaire designed to quantify the emotion. They
identified six key characteristics of awe:

1. Self-diminishment: Feeling small in the face of
    something vast
2. Time alteration: A perception of time slowing or
    standing still



3. Physical sensations: Goosebumps, chills, or a dropped
    jaw
4. Connectedness: A deep sense of unity with others
    and the Universe
5. Vastness: The feeling of encountering something
    grand or overwhelming
6. Cognitive accommodation: Struggling to process the
    immensity of an experience

To test their framework, Yaden and his team asked
over 1,100 participants to describe awe-inspiring moments,
ranging from encounters with nature to witnessing acts of
profound human achievement. The findings confirmed that
awe is a distinct and universal emotion, one that shapes our
perception of the world and our place in it.
Modern research suggests that experiencing awe reduces
stress, depression, and anxiety while enhancing overall
well-being. Studies show that individuals who regularly
experience awe report higher life satisfaction, lower levels
of inflammation, and even improved social behavior. One
experiment revealed that people who stared at towering euca-
lyptus trees were more likely to help a stranger afterward,
highlighting awe’s ability to increase empathy and altruism.
While scientific breakthroughs may soon bring engi-
neered awe experiences, researchers emphasize that awe
is already within our reach. Berkeley psychologist Dacher
Keltner, who helped shape modern awe research, found
that most people experience awe multiple times per week—
whether through nature, music, art, spirituality, or witnessing
acts of moral beauty.



Keltner’s research identified eight “wonders” of life that
commonly evoke awe:

1. Moral beauty: Witnessing acts of kindness and
    courage
2. Nature: Majestic landscapes, towering mountains, or
    a starry sky
3. Collective movement: Watching synchronized dance
    or sports
4. Music: Hearing a breathtaking symphony or song
5. Art: Masterpieces that move the soul
6. Spirituality: Moments of deep transcendence or faith
7. Big ideas: Discovering profound scientific or philo-
    sophical truths
8. Mortality: Encounters with life, death, and the fleet-
    ing nature of existence

Incorporating awe into daily life is not only possible but
also transformative. Whether it’s watching a sunrise, reading
a mind-expanding book, or witnessing human resilience, awe
reminds us of life’s grandeur.
I’ve since realized my youth was filled with moments of
awe, which is probably why I am able to relatively easily
invoke an internal state of awe in my daily meditation rou-
tine. I have learned that awe is not just an emotion; it is a
gateway to a higher state of being. It humbles us, expands
our awareness, and dissolves the barriers between self and
world. In moments of awe, we touch the infinite, experienc-
ing life as something vast, interconnected, and sacred.



In an age where we are increasingly caught up in the
minutiae of daily life, awe pulls us out of our smallness and
into the grandeur of existence. It reminds us that beyond
our worries, beyond our ambitions, beyond even our own
identities, lies something far greater, timeless, and beautifully
unknowable.
I suggest that every day we step outside, look up at the
stars, lose ourselves in a piece of music, or stand in silent
reverence before a work of art. The sublime is always within
reach. Awe is waiting.

#### Discover Your Superpowers

```
Do What You Do Best
```
If the concept of having superpowers seems like it belongs
in comic books, don’t worry. All it takes is a little reflection
to find your own.
Start by investigating your youth. What are the most
joyful times you remember from your childhood? What
stories are the easiest to recall from when you were young?
As you relive those moments, do any repeated themes stand
out? In times of idleness, your brain looked for happiness
in those stories and memories, and eventually, they became
your default mode network. Whether you knew it or not, you
built an affinity toward doing those couple of things, and
they became your superpowers.
```


Happiness is endemic to all of us—we just need to discover
our strengths. And if we do voluntary acts on a regular basis
that are aligned with our superpowers, we give ourselves the
gift of happiness in the present. Every day I spend operating
in my superpowers, I am increasing my happiness quotient.
I have five superpowers, so I don’t necessarily engage with
each one every day. But no matter what I’m doing, I make
sure I employ one of them
so that it always contributes
to my greater happiness.
Your superpowers are your
own, and you will have to
embark on your own jour-
ney to discover yours, but I hope the following descriptions
of my superpowers give you a good idea of where to start.

The Power of Continuous Learning and Integrating

My first and most fervent superpower is learning. I am a life-
long learner, perpetually finding new areas to research. Every
day, I give myself the gift of learning by talking to people,
reading books, listening to podcasts, and researching the
masters and the non-experts alike. Every encounter exposes
me to new information and new modes of thinking. It helps
me to make sure I am not closed off to anything just because
I might be biased toward one frame of thought.
For me, learning is never about how much I know, and
it’s especially not about lording my knowledge over others.
Every time I learn something new, it is primarily a discovery
of all the things I don’t know. A new world of possibility
opens up with every new piece of information.
When I engage in voluntary acts of learning, it raises the
happiness quotient for my whole life. This pursuit overflows

```
Happiness is endemic to all of us—
we just need to discover
our strengths.
```


into how I engage with others. Most of the companies I have
created are intentionally organized as learning-based orga-
nizations, meaning that perpetual learning is a core value of
the company.

Mastering Concentration and Focus

My second superpower is concentration and focus. I’ve been
an avid meditator for many years. I rarely miss my daily med-
itations, and I use different types of meditations throughout
the day, from small moments of breathful mindfulness all the
way to deep spiritual meditation. So I give myself the gift of
deep concentration and deep focus, and it, too, drives up my
happiness and awe quotient.

Visionary and Futurist Thinking

My superpower of being a visionary enables my roles as a
dad and a CEO. A CEO has four jobs:

- Be a visionary (you can alternatively be the integra-
    tor, but you cannot be both)
- Be captain of the cash flow
- Be a chief coach, mentor, and motivator
- Be the architect of culture

So my first job as CEO is to have a vision of the future.
I must anticipate what’s going to happen in the world so I
can lead the company through obstacles. Meditation actually
flows into my capacity as a visionary. When I meditate, I
often receive great insights along with a clear and unfettered



picture of what the future could be. What I see is not abso-
lutely written in stone, but it gives me a clear and concise
picture of the future, which gives me purpose, which then
gives me direction.
I give myself that gift of vision by thinking about the
vision of the future every day, and you can see how my
strengths all correlate to one another.

Teaching, Coaching, and Motivating Through Storytelling

Jay Rifenbarry said, “We teach best in life what we want to
learn the most.” Learning is one of my strongest inclinations,
and teaching naturally flows out of it. I’m a coach, a mentor,
a CEO, a dad to my older son and three little girls, and I’m a
grandfather too. When I give myself the gift of coaching and
mentoring through any and all of these capacities, I thrive.
I stopped coaching early in my career, and as soon as I
did, I intrinsically felt a loss in my life. Eventually, I realized
that loss was because it was one of my superpowers feeding
my happiness quotient. When it was gone, I didn’t have the
joy to replace it, and anxiety rushed in to fill the gap.
I haven’t gone back to coaching completely, but now I
know how to employ my mentoring superpower in ways that
fill the void. I’ve engrossed myself as a mentor by joining
communities like Abundance360, writing a book, and inter-
acting with others in new ways.

Simplifying Life as a Facilitator

Facilitating is key as a business leader. Everything you do is
to make life easier for yourself, your clients, your employees,
and your loved ones. When I go through personal difficulty, I



always look for ways to simplify and universalize the lessons
I learn so they benefit not only me but all those around me
as well. It’s like putting up a circus tent. Once that center
pole goes up, it props up the rest of the tent with it. You are
the tent pole in your life—if you elevate yourself, all those
around you are elevated as well.
That’s why I love simplifying life as a facilitator and gal-
vanizer. One reason I am writing this book is to take the big,
frightening truths of the world I am learning about and clarify
them so everyone can benefit. These ideas—the mind-body
connection, the quantum field—are not well-known, espe-
cially in the Western world of modern medicine and the
objective reality of Newtonian physics. It gives me energy
to facilitate knowledge of these things through the form of
this book.
These five superpowers have been instrumental in my
happiness. I can consistently raise the most controllable por-
tion of the psychological well-being quotient—voluntary
acts—by just doing the things I love. You will be amazed by
how free you feel when you identify your superpowers and
start to give them to yourself as daily gifts.


#### Live Your Core Values

```
Presence, Purpose, and Prosperity
```
Once you make it a habit of filling your life with
superpower-fueled happiness, you will notice a dif-
ference in your mental well-being. To make sure your
progress is sustainable, you will have to continue the thought
process constantly to stave off the failure of information in
the quantum field. The quantum field is the perfect place
of knowledge. I am a quantum body—one with the ability
to hold knowledge and process information. But I need to
continue to build mental muscle in order for it to maintain
health through the ups and downs of life. What will you hold
onto to steady yourself? Your core values.
In creating core values, you must answer the question,
“What is it that I want to become, and how do I want to be



represented?” The answer forms your core values, but they
can change throughout your life. I have three core values to
guide and ground my every action:

- Presence
- Purpose
- Prosperity

If your core values stabilize you, then mindsets move you
forward. I have eight mindsets to govern my actions, and
each is shaped by my core values:

- Mindfulness
- Humility
- Curiosity
- Abundance
- Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP)
- Exponential Thinking
- Taking “Moonshots”
- Gratitude

Whenever I find myself not being in alignment with my
superpowers, core values, and mindset, I ask myself, “Am I
wilfully choosing this alternate path, or am I just wasting
time?” The answer results in an adjustment to my thinking
or puts me back on track—either way, it’s a good thing. As I
go through each core value in detail, I will explain how each
works in conjunction with my mindset to produce applica-
tions for everyday life.



Presence

A little-known German philosopher, known as Meister
Eckhart, claimed, “I have often said that God is creating
the entire Universe fully and totally in this present now.
Everything God creates, he creates ‘now’ all at once.”
I find this conclusion fascinating because while he is a
mystic, Deepak Chopra says essentially the same thing in his
new book, _Quantum Body._ He explains the quantum field
as identical to the idea of everything being _now_. The smallest
details conform to the big picture. We are each a quantum
body of intelligence and have some degree of control over a
quantum field of perfect information.
Remember how I said the Universe is not just matter and
energy, but it’s also information? That universal knowledge,
as it relates to us, is our quantum body. It takes perfect intel-
ligence to do the millions of metabolic cellular processes that
happen to us every day. The perfection only breaks down
when it encounters the environment we expose ourselves to
and our imperfect DNA. From there, we grow into imper-
fect humans with imperfect childhoods and, ultimately, an
imperfect prefrontal cortex.
That imperfection is why we need to heal the body,
mind, and spirit in the first place. Well-being breaks down
whenever there is a failure in intelligence, but well-being is
strengthened whenever intelligence flows naturally.
Being a dad to three young girls, I came upon this quote
from, of all places, Master Oogway from _Kung Fu Panda,_ but
it captures my sentiment perfectly: “The past is history. The
future is a mystery. Today [Now] is a gift, and that’s why they
call it the present.”
Presence is my first core value because I acknowledge
this truth. I believe all humanity must learn how to live in



the present because the now is where all creation resides.
Every time we dwell in the past or the future, we live in what
Buddha called a world of suffering.
In the end, I have discovered that presence is the path
to the center of universal knowledge—of being. Presence is
the connection point between the center of “self ” and the
oneness of all.

Mindset Connection

```
Mindfulness directly enhances presence by promoting
awareness and engagement in the current moment. It
helps you focus on the here and now.
```
```
Humility keeps you open to learning from each
moment. It encourages genuine interactions and atten-
tiveness to others.
```
```
Curiosity drives you to explore and fully experience the
present moment. It keeps you engaged and interested
in your immediate environment.
```
```
An abundance mindset allows you to appreciate and
make the most of the present moment. It fosters grati-
tude and a positive outlook.
```
```
Having an MTP provides a strong sense of direction
and focus, allowing you to be fully present in actions
that align with your broader mission.
```
```
Exponential thinking requires a deep understanding
of current capabilities and trends, grounding you in the
present while planning for the future.
```


```
Pursuing moonshots keeps you engaged and focused
on ambitious goals but requires being attuned to cur-
rent possibilities and resources.
```
```
Gratitude fosters a deep appreciation for the current
moment and the people in it. It helps you focus on the
positive aspects of the present, enhancing your sense of
fulfillment.
```
Purpose

My next core value is purpose. Purpose is that which we want
to be known for. It gives us direction to shape our lives and
actions. Moonshots are an excellent example of living with
purpose. A moonshot is something tactical to strive for, like
writing a book or owning a company. The direction of every
company I’ve started and every investment I have made is
related to my desire to improve the world during the time
of AI—the most influential technological advancement we
have ever seen. I want to make AI approachable. That’s one
of my moonshots.
Another is to achieve enlightenment—a balanced exis-
tence of body, mind, and spirit and become fully centered
in my higher self. I want to elevate the collective conscious-
ness with me by fostering a world where every individual can
realize their highest potential and live in harmony. This book
is a step toward achieving that.

The other strategy for emphasizing purpose in your life
is putting your Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP)
into words. My MTP is to inspire and accelerate mankind’s
transition to a world where every digital interaction is rooted
in transparency and trust, empowering individuals, leaders,
and communities through decentralized technology, open
AI, and robust digital asset security.

Mindset Connection

```
Mindfulness allows for deeper introspection, helping
you stay aligned with your core purpose. It enables you
to make conscious decisions that reflect your mission
and values.
```
```
Humility ensures that you remain open to feedback and
new perspectives, helping you stay true to your purpose
and continuously improve.
```
```
Curiosity fuels the pursuit of knowledge and under-
standing. It helps you discover new paths and refine
your mission.
```


```
Believing in abundance helps you pursue your purpose
without fear of scarcity. It encourages generosity and
sharing.
```
```
An MTP embodies your core value of purpose by driv-
ing you towards significant and meaningful goals. It
provides a clear and compelling vision for your efforts.
```
```
Exponential thinking aligns with your visionary and
futurist strengths, helping you envision and work
toward transformative goals.
```
```
Moonshots are inherently aligned with a purpose-driven
mindset, as they aim for transformative and meaningful
impact.
```
```
Gratitude promotes a positive and appreciative outlook
on your journey and achievements. It helps you recog-
nize the value in your efforts and stay motivated.
```
Prosperity

Finally, we come to the core value of prosperity. It is my goal
in life to live and improve myself, not out of egoistic motiva-
tions but out of selflessness.
Buddha said that the secrets to life are threefold: one,
enlightenment comes when you realize living in the past or
the future is a life of suffering; two, life is ever-changing; and
three, live selflessly.
So, to me, prosperity is learning to live selflessly in ser-
vitude to others, with gratitude for all things. Prosperity
flows from these. Well-being is prosperity, as are wealth and



relationships. But it is our job to improve ourselves so that
we can contribute to the prosperity of the collective con-
sciousness of the Universe.
Selflessness is our gift to the Universe.

Mindset Connection

```
A mindful approach helps you manage stress and main-
tain mental clarity, contributing to overall prosperity.
```
```
Humility builds strong relationships and collabora-
tions, which are crucial for long-term success. It fosters
a supportive environment where collective prosperity
can thrive.
```
```
Curiosity leads to innovation and discovering new
opportunities. It keeps you adaptable and open to new
ways of achieving success.
```
```
An abundance mindset attracts opportunities and suc-
cess. It promotes a positive and proactive approach to
achieving prosperity.
```
```
Pursuing an MTP often leads to significant impact
and success. It motivates you to achieve extraordinary
results, contributing to both personal and collective
prosperity.
```
```
Exponential thinking drives you to seek and create
scalable solutions, leading to significant growth and
prosperity. It encourages leveraging technology and
innovation.
```


Taking **moonshots** can lead to breakthrough inno-
vations and substantial success. It embodies a bold
approach to achieving prosperity through ambitious
and visionary goals.

**Gratitude** contributes to prosperity by fostering a
mindset of appreciation and contentment. It attracts
positive energy and opportunities.

#### Tools for Change

## Let’s return to Haidt’s elephant metaphor. If the elephant
represents the subconscious and unconscious mind, then
our conscious awareness is the rider on top of the ele-
phant. When the elephant sees a peanut at the other end
of the room, that rider is absolutely powerless to make the
elephant stay put. This illustrates how we make decisions
because even if our conscious awareness wants to make
a good decision, we are incapable of controlling our sub-
conscious and unconscious mind to obey. No amount of
willpower would suffice.
However, there is a way to retrain our elephant. In other
words, we can retrain the pathways of our mind toward
healthier patterns of action. There are three proven methods:
```
1. **Meditation:** This is the most fundamental method
    for retraining brain habits. It can create profound



```
and permanent changes, but it’s difficult. It requires a
lifelong practice of dedication and effort.
```
2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** I mentioned
    this before as my pathway back up during that first
    crisis. The benefits can also be profound with the
    right therapist and willingness to change. However,
    I do not believe it possesses the ability to affect the
    mind and physiology as deeply as meditation can.
3. **Drugs, legal or otherwise:** These are aids to the
    evolution of the spirit. Drugs come in two catego-
    ries—one contains the normal psychotropic drugs
    psychologists administer, such as selective serotonin
    reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These work by affect-
    ing how your brain reacts to serotonin and how your
    cognitive processes flow. But they don’t work for
    everyone, and they also make you reliant on the drug
    rather than solving the underlying problem deep
    inside of you. The other category contains psyche-
    delics. While the use of psychedelics is controversial
    and illegal in some respects, it can retrain your mind
    and help uncover the underlying reasons for your
    predisposed mental pathways.

If these methods intimidate you, that’s okay. It takes time
to figure out how to implement them properly—it certainly
did for me. Wherever you can implement these, however, you
will begin to see healing in body, mind, and spirit.

Meditations: The Bridge to Healing and Wholeness

Imagine a moment of pure stillness—a time when the
cacophony of daily life fades into the background and a



deep sense of calm washes over you. In that stillness lies the
ancient practice of meditation, a simple yet profound tool
for healing the body, mind, and spirit. While the wisdom
of meditation has been passed down through millennia by
sages, monks, and philosophers, its transformative power
is now being illuminated by modern science in ways those
ancient masters could have only dreamed of.
Meditation is not reserved for mystics or spiritual seekers.
It is a practical, accessible practice with measurable benefits
for anyone willing to try. Research from leading institutions
like Harvard Medical School, the University of California,
and the American Heart Association has shown that medita-
tion can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, improve mental
clarity, and even enhance cellular repair. Studies have linked
regular meditation to raising the brain’s baseline gamma
wave activity to promote cognition and memory, decreases in
cortisol—the stress hormone—and increases in grey matter
density in areas of the brain associated with empathy and
self-awareness.
But meditation does not merely work on the mind—it has
a profound effect on the body. Practices such as mindfulness
and transcendental meditation activate the parasympathetic
nervous system, shifting the body out of fight-or-flight mode
into a state of deep relaxation. This can enhance immune
function, reduce chronic pain, and promote better sleep.
Emerging research even suggests that meditation may slow
the aging process at a cellular level by preserving telomeres,
the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes.
Recent advancements in meditation research have intro-
duced a “general theory of meditation” that aligns traditional
practices with cognitive science, particularly predictive pro-
cessing, which states that we don’t experience the world as
it is but as we predict it to be. This theory proposes four



progressive stages of meditation, each deconstructing the
mind’s habitual ways of perceiving the world.

- **Focused Attention** : This beginner-level practice
    involves concentrating on an object (e.g., breath,
    mantra) to settle the mind. It increases “precision
    weighting,” amplifying focus on one element while
    quieting others, like a volume knob for the predictive
    mind. This practice can reduce stress but doesn’t nec-
    essarily lead to deep insights.
- **Open Monitoring** : Once the mind settles, medi-
    tation shifts to observing thoughts and sensations
    without attachment—meaning judging, fixating on,
    or ruminating on the phenomena. The mind loosens
    its grip on rigid perceptions, making thoughts appear
    less intrusive. Practitioners begin to recognize aware-
    ness as separate from mental content. This can also be
    described as mindfulness. This is where insights begin.
- **Non-Dual Awareness** : At this stage, the distinction
    between observer and observed dissolves. Meditation
    erases dualistic perceptions (e.g., self vs. other, good
    vs. bad), unveiling an underlying awareness beyond
    conceptual thinking. This experience, often described
    as a state of profound presence, aligns with mystical
    traditions.
- **Cessation:** The deepest form of meditation
    extinguishes all conscious experience, akin to a
    self-induced blackout where the mind has no pri-
    ors. This phenomenon, known as nirodha-samāpatti,
    is traditionally associated with advanced Buddhist
    meditation. Emerging research suggests it represents



```
a complete “reset” of the predictive mind, enabling
profound cognitive reprogramming.
```
The predictive processing theory explains how medi-
tation alters perception. Our brains generate experience
based on ingrained “priors,” beliefs or expectations based
on experiences from the past ranging from deep and ances-
tral to superficial and personal. Meditation progressively
deconstructs the mind by turning down the volume of each
layer of stacked priors, releasing the grip they ordinarily
hold on awareness, and allowing more fluid and adaptable
perceptions.
This framework also highlights why most modern med-
itators, who primarily engage in focused attention practices,
rarely experience profound transformations. Advanced med-
itation techniques systematically deconstruct habitual mental
frameworks, leading to deeper states of consciousness and
well-being in ways more conducive to human flourishing.
Yet, the impact of meditation goes even deeper, touching
the intangible realms of spirit. In a world where many of us
feel disconnected—from others, from purpose, and even from
ourselves—meditation offers a pathway back to wholeness.
By fostering a sense of presence and inner stillness, it allows
us to reconnect with our higher selves, enabling a greater
sense of compassion, gratitude, and spiritual alignment. In
this way, meditation becomes a means for discovering the
deeper truths of existence.
By linking ancient wisdom with neuroscience, this
evolving scientific approach provides a refined roadmap
for deepening meditation practice and understanding the
human mind.

Meditation is ultimately a journey of healing and
self-discovery. As you progress through these phases—from
concentration to energy mastery—you unlock the mind’s
potential for clarity, resilience, and inner peace. By integrat-
ing these practices into your life, you cultivate a sanctuary of
stillness within, empowering you to heal and thrive amidst
life’s challenges.

Harnessing the Mind with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the most widely
researched and effective methods for improving mental
health. Developed by pioneers such as Dr. Aaron T. Beck,
Albert Ellis, Judith Beck,
and Donald Meichenbaum,
CBT focuses on the inter-
play between our thoughts,
emotions, and behaviors.
At its core, CBT teaches us
that by changing how we
think and act, we can trans-
form how we feel, paving
the way for healthier, more
fulfilling lives.
When you first enter a CBT session, your therapist will
aim to establish a collaborative relationship. CBT is not
about being an active participant in your own growth.
The therapist begins by checking in with you, focusing
on your feelings, goals, and challenges. The heart of the ses-
sion often involves examining situations where distress arose.
For example, if you felt anxious at work, your therapist might
guide you to uncover the automatic thoughts you experienced

```
Meditation is ultimately a journey
of healing and self-discovery.
As you progress through these
phases—from concentration to
energy mastery—you unlock
the mind’s potential for clarity,
resilience, and inner peace.
```


in that moment. Perhaps you thought, “I’m going to fail this
project,” which fueled your anxiety.
Your therapist helps you question the validity of these
thoughts. They might ask:

- What evidence supports this thought?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- Is there a more balanced way to view this situation?

Beyond thought work, CBT often includes actionable
steps. For example, if you avoid social situations due to fear
of rejection, your therapist may work with you to create grad-
ual exposure exercises, helping you confront and reduce your
fear over time.
At-home tasks such as journaling your thoughts, practic-
ing relaxation techniques, or testing new behaviors solidify
learning and empower you to continue to progress outside
therapy.
The magic of CBT lies in its longevity. Unlike treatments
that focus solely on alleviating symptoms, CBT equips you
with lifelong tools to navigate life’s challenges. Here are
some of the long-term benefits:

- Breaking Negative Cycles
- Improved Emotional Regulation
- Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills
- Increased Self-Efficacy
- Reduction in Relapse Risk



CBT’s success lies in its practicality and accessibility. It
demystifies the connection between our thoughts, feelings,
and actions, teaching us that we are not prisoners of our
minds. While not a magic cure, it offers a path forward—an
opportunity to reshape your life from the inside out.

Th e Role of Drugs in Healing the Mind

The final method for retraining the elephant and heal-
ing the mind involves drugs—both pharmaceuticals and
psychedelics. In modern medicine, pharmaceuticals have
become a cornerstone for treating mental health conditions.
Pharmaceuticals have dramatically improved the prognosis
for many mental health conditions. However, their effective-
ness varies depending on the disorder, the individual, and the
medication.
Pharmaceuticals have particularly benefited those
struggling with depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disor-
der, schizophrenia, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to name
a few. Each of these requires a specific type of medication, but
they have been proven to help heal and stabilize the mind.



Categories of mental health medications include anti-
depressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics,
and stimulants. While each has its place, there will always
be challenges and considerations to using pharmaceuticals.
Many have side effects to be aware of, and particularly when
patients have comorbid conditions, they may require multi-
ple medications, which increases complexity. There is also a
strong social stigma that may deter individuals from seeking
help or adhering to treatment.
Pharmaceuticals have transformed mental health care,
but they are not a cure-all. Effective treatment often com-
bines medication with psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, and
social support. Understanding the science behind these med-
ications can demystify the process and empower informed
decision-making.
Psychedelics are a diverse class of substances that alter
perception, mood, and cognition by modulating neurotrans-
mitter systems in the brain. They are increasingly being
studied for their profound effects on consciousness and
their therapeutic potential for conditions such as depression,
PTSD, and addiction. These substances primarily affect the
serotonin system but also influence other neurotransmit-
ters like dopamine, glutamate, and GABA, leading to their
wide-ranging psychological and physiological effects.
My experience with using psychedelics came much later
in my life, well after I had already been using meditation
and CBT to heal my body and mind. My initial interest was
in attaining spiritual growth by experiencing altered states
of consciousness. I firmly believe that my advanced state of
meditative practice is probably why I progressed relatively
rapidly in achieving my awakening to an enlightened state.
I won’t spend too much time explaining the various types
of psychedelics and their effects, but I have created a chart



explaining the mechanism and impact of some of the com-
mon types. Each provides a specific benefit and has been
proven to aid in certain conditions.

Summary of Psychedelics and Their Neurotransmitter Impact

R ecent research has illuminated the potential benefits
of psychedelics on mental health and overall well-being.
Substances like psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA are being
studied for their therapeutic effects on conditions such as
depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction.
Psychedelics are believed to work by reopening “critical
periods” in the brain, enhancing neuroplasticity, and allow-
ing for the reorganization of neural circuits. This can lead to
lasting changes in behavior and cognition, which are benefi-
cial in therapeutic settings.
While the therapeutic potential of psychedelics is prom-
ising, there are and likely will always be concerns about
adverse effects and the quality of existing research. While
preliminary findings are encouraging, further comprehen-
sive studies are essential to fully understand the benefits,



mechanisms, and potential risks associated with psychedelic
therapies.

the science behind pharmaceuticals and psychedelics and the
potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

#### Healing the Spirit

We have made our way through healing the body and the
mind. Spirit is the only element left, but healing the
spirit is the most elusive and complex part of the path
to bliss.
I had been employing all three methods of healing—
meditation, CBT, and drugs—to continue to retrain my
neural pathways when I realized that spirit was something I
didn’t understand at all.
I returned to the commit-learn-do framework and com-
mitted to finding spiritual enlightenment. I then began to
research—not just the ancient Hindu, Buddhist, Christian,
Islamic, Toltec, and other philosophers and mystics, but
the more modern ones too. I was led to the work of Paul
Brunton, Eckhart Tolle, Sam Harris, Daniel Schmidt, Joe
Dispenza, Dandapani, Steve Taylor, Dawson Church, James
Plath, Lynne McTaggart, Deepak Chopra, MD, and Michael



Singer, most of whom I have mentioned already. All of these
thought leaders are united by their recognition of spirit as
something else— _something other._
Scan the QR code below for a complete list of resources
related to the study of spirit.

In the first couple of chapters, I alluded to the under-
standing that perhaps our conventional understanding of
spirit and consciousness is wrong. Science typically teaches
that a Big Bang created time and space and over millennia
resulted in the evolution of man and thereby consciousness,
but what if consciousness is something akin to universal
knowledge between all things? If it is collective informa-
tion of everything that has ever existed—accessible to any
system or organism at any time if they are open to it—then
perhaps this universal knowledge is actually the precursor to
time and space.
In that case, the narrative is reversed. Consciousness gave
way to the Big Bang, and ultimately, man created a mech-
anism for translating itself, namely time and space. The
implications require a dramatic shift in perception.
For example, if you consider the end of the Universe, what
might that look like? The laws of thermodynamics explain
that energy can never be created or destroyed, and the law of
entropy states that we will always tend toward disorder.


```
Healing the Spirit
```
At the end of the Universe, the stars will have all burned
out and the black holes will have evaporated. In that heat
death, all energy will be evenly dispersed throughout the
Universe as cold, dark energy. In other words, universal
knowledge will be returned to the supreme quiet that started
it all.
Bliss is quiet. That is why, when we are able to shed our
body-self and mind-self, we ultimately find peace. People
with near-death experiences find light and peaceful rapture
because they are momentarily free from the complications
of life.
Finding that quiet bliss is what it means to heal the spirit.
I have experienced it while still in my human body-self and
it is approachable for all.
We must strive for Enlightenment, the realization that
everything is one. Every religion has its version of this awak-
ening—everybody has their language for it—but they all
describe the same thing using the language of their time and
context.
We naturally see differences between big and small, male
and female, tall and short, yin and yang, and order and chaos,
but to be awakened is to eliminate the conception of these
differences. All is one.
The first step in reaching this realization is eliminating
the sense of self. We have been looking at ways to fix the
body, heal the mind, and make the self tolerable, but now, the
mindset must change.
Instead of looking to add, we look to eliminate. Take
meditation, for example. In the search for spiritual heal-
ing, meditation is no longer about finding new techniques
and creating new pathways for yourself. Instead, it becomes
“un-meditation.” You must reduce the mind, body, feelings,



emotions, and sense of self because there is no self in the per-
fect you. There is only the unity of collective consciousness.

Meditation Practices for Spiritual Growth and Inner Peace

As we saw in healing the mind, we can control awareness of
our body, mind, and spirit as well as our current reality within
the present moment. The practiced can become aware of all
energy patterns and harness them to change the physiology
of their bodies and mind, for better or worse.
Meditation is the practice of recognizing the need
to calm the mind just the same as calming the body.
Counterintuitively, this drives one’s conscious awareness
to a higher frequency energy level. As such, the meditative
approach is a singular focus on the openness and connected-
ness to all energy.
I vividly remember the day I experienced one of my most
profound insights while deeply meditating. While embrac-
ing the above concept and successfully surrendering my body,
emotions, and thoughts, I began to feel a familiar openness
and connectedness. However, not until I surrendered my
meditation expectations did I find myself in a deeply spir-
itual state. I can only describe it as spacious stillness and an
overwhelming sense of well-being—or, in other words, bliss.
Upon returning to the moment, I realized the state was
familiar to me! I recalled that I had occasionally experienced
this state as a young child. While trying to fall asleep, I would
occasionally experience a feeling that everything was getting
very close, larger, expanding, and becoming one with me.
I remember being scared by the feeling the first few times
and would will it away. In time, however, I began to embrace
the state, and it led to a sublime state of peace and calm.


```
Healing the Spirit
```
Eventually, the experience left me in my youth, but medita-
tion brought it back.

Our Reason for Being

At this point in my personal development, I have con-
cluded that our access to infinite universal knowledge is
undeniable—we simply need to set aside our mind-body
self, including all the great strides we’ve made to improve
ourselves. In fact, I believe our primary reason for being is
to improve our mind-body selves and ultimately live a life
of selflessness, altruism, and service to others in order to
make better decisions for the betterment of all collective
consciousness.
I posit that our existence is akin to a Sphere of Self.
The outer layer of our sphere is where we experience all
the perpetual phenomena
and sensations of life that
affect us. All the things
that happen in the world
and Universe around us, of
which we have no control.
Slightly further in are
all these things that affect
our bodies—our five senses
of hearing, seeing, touching,
tasting, and smelling. Next
are the things that affect our mind-body, such as feelings.
Continuing further in are all the sensations of the mind,
including our awareness, our willful thoughts, our visualiza-
tions, our subconscious and unconscious thoughts, and our
emotions (the energy of our feelings in motion, translated by
our intellect). The lowest-energy emotions, such as shame,

```
Our primary reason for being is
to improve our mind-body selves
and ultimately live a life of
selflessness, altruism, and service
to others in order to make better
decisions for the betterment of all
collective consciousness.
```


guilt, apathy, grief, hate, and fear, are further outside than
higher-energy emotions like awe, love, joy, and peace. This
innermost ring I like to refer to as “the sphere of awe.” You
might envision the Sphere of Self as the spiral of a hur-
ricane. (In fact, the geometry of the spiral is all over the
natural and mystical Universe—but that’s for another dis-
cussion.) Like the calm in the eye of the hurricane, there is
calm at the center of our Sphere of Self. At our core is pure
consciousness—bliss.
What we perceive as manifestation is more like observing
one reality from an infinite realm of simultaneous potential
realities. The simple act of observing a single potential real-
ity collapses it into what becomes our objective reality. As
such, all realities of self exist simultaneously, like overlapping
concentric spheres. And our infinite possible spheres of self
overlap with the overlapping concentric possible spheres of
all conscious beings that have ever existed and will exist. At
the center of all of it is pure consciousness, God, Nirvana,
the soul, universal knowledge, or whatever other man-made,
not-quite-right label we can give it.

Samadhi

In my research, I learned that states of spiritual enlighten-
ment have names. I knew I was not the first to come across
higher levels of awakening, but I was pleased to find such
large bodies of research spanning all of history.
Samadhi is a profound state of consciousness in spiritual
practices, particularly in yogic and meditation traditions. It
represents the culmination of mental concentration, where
the mind becomes completely absorbed in an object of
focus, leading to a direct experience of unity and transcen-
dence beyond the ego. Often, the sense of space and time


```
Healing the Spirit
```
disappears. Everything is experienced as eternal and in the
present moment.
There are two broad categories of Samadhi: with dis-
tinctions and without. In Samadhi with distinctions, the
meditator may focus on physical objects, cosmic energies,
bliss itself, or pure awareness, but regardless of the object,
some individuality remains.
Samadhi without distinctions is the higher form. In this
state, all mental activity ceases, and the meditator dissolves
completely into the universal consciousness. This is true
freedom from self, impressions, and desires. The only thing
higher is Sahaja Samadhi, where one achieves Samadhi
without distinctions and integrates it spontaneously into
everyday life. In other words, they don’t achieve the state;
they live it.
This is true healing of the spirit. In the final part of the
book, I will share my experiences in striving toward this goal.
I hope this inspires you to model your healing on my own
successes and learn from my mistakes.

#### Achieving Body, Mind, and Spirit Harmony

Achieving balance in body, mind, and spirit is a harmoni-
ous process of tuning into your inner self, aligning with
your purpose, and nurturing holistic wellness. Here’s a
simple path forward inspired by my philosophy:
```
1. **Balance the Body: Nourish and Energize**

```
Move Daily : Engage in mindful movement (yoga, stretching,
walking in nature, tai chi, gardening, exercise, playing with
children, playing a sport, anything that keeps your body mov-
ing—preferably outside) to reconnect with your physical self.
```
```
Nourish with Intention : Sometime each morning, get ten
minutes of sunshine. Eat focusing on whole foods, getting
```


enough protein, and eating three times more fiber than is
typically recommended. Eat slowly, with gratitude.

_Rest Fully_ : Prioritize deep, restorative sleep and include
moments of stillness throughout the day.

_Try This_ : Start your day with a glass of water infused with
elemental hydrogen and electrolytes (e.g., LMNT, Liquid
IV, or Baja Gold Mineral Sea Salt), gently stretch outdoors
in the sun barefoot in the grass, and take five deep breaths to
awaken and energize your body.

2. **Balance the Mind: Clarity and Focus**

_Mindfulness Practice_ : Meditate to cultivate present-moment
awareness and reduce mental clutter.

_Mental Nutrition_ : Be conscious of what you consume—books,
conversations, media. Choose inspiration over stimulation.
Actively choose to surround yourself with people who ele-
vate and inspire you and appreciate you enriching their lives
in return. Finally, have more positive thoughts than negative
thoughts every day by doing voluntary acts aligned to your
superpowers, seeking out moments of awe and wonder, and
minimizing expectations of events, yourself, and others.

_Reflective Journaling_ : Ask yourself, “What am I feeling right
now, and why?”

_Try This_ : Dedicate twenty minutes each morning to medita-
tion. See my meditation video at PeteSacco.com for ideas on
including meditation into your daily routine.



3. **Balance the Spirit: Connection and Purpose**

_Connect Within_ : Explore your values, passions, and what gives
your life meaning. Contemplate your mindset and the deci-
sions you’ve made throughout the day and decide whether
they were aligned with your core values and purpose. If not,
commit to yourself to do better.

_Nature as Teacher_ : Spend time outdoors. Witness the sacred
in the ordinary.

Acts of Selflessness and Compassion: Serve others with an
open heart—it realigns your spirit with love.

_Try This_ : Each evening, list three things you’re grateful for
and one act of kindness you shared or received.

The Bliss Equation

In keeping with my engineering background and my pen-
chant for liking things neatly wrapped up in equations, the
way to start living in bliss can be expressed simply. Here is
a powerful equation to keep in mind as you go about your
day-to-day life:

```
Body Vitality + Mind Clarity + Spiritual Purpose
= Living in Bliss
```

### Achieving Enlightenment

```
Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise;
seek what they sought.
```
```
—Matsuo Bashō
```

#### The Path to Enlightenment

```
A Life of Constant Bliss
```
The quest for enlightenment is a universal pursuit,
interpreted differently across cultures, religions, and
philosophies. Whether through the Vedantic realization
of Brahman, the Buddhist cessation of suffering, the Taoist
harmony with the Way, the Christian divine union, or the
Sufi annihilation of the self, all traditions point toward a
state of inner freedom and ultimate understanding.
As modern seekers explore spirituality beyond dogma,
enlightenment is increasingly understood as an experiential
realization rather than a doctrinal belief, making it more rel-
evant than ever in today’s chaotic world.
You now have the tools you need to start living in bliss.
It’s a mountain to climb, but I can promise you, the view



from the top is stunning. I started writing this book with
some idea of bliss but without the assurance of personal
experience. Now, as I’m finishing the last chapters, that is no
longer true. I have experienced bliss, joining my higher self
in its unity with all things.
As I share these experiences, I know your journey may
be different, but I firmly believe you, too, can experience and
perhaps even transcend the bliss that I’ve found.

A Word on Ethical and Responsible Use

The journey to Enlightenment, especially through psy-
chedelics, is not without risks. These substances should
be approached with reverence, preparation, and guidance.
Legal frameworks and settings also play a critical role in
ensuring safety and maxi-
mizing potential benefits.
For those interested, partic-
ipating in approved clinical
trials or guided retreats is
often the safest and most
effective path.
That being said, psy-
chedelics like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT offer unique and
profound opportunities to explore altered states of conscious-
ness that can facilitate spiritual awakening and glimpses of
Enlightenment. These substances have the potential to help
dissolve the barriers of the ego and foster a sense of intercon-
nectedness with the Universe.
However, it is important to emphasize that these tools
are not a shortcut to Enlightenment but rather a catalyst
that must be combined with intentional practices such as
meditation, mindfulness, and self-inquiry to integrate and

```
I know your journey may be
different, but I firmly believe you,
too, can experience and perhaps
even transcend the bliss that
I’ve found.
```

sustain the insights gained. Enlightenment is not just a peak
experience but an ongoing process of living with awareness,
compassion, and alignment with one’s higher self.

Glimpses of Enlightenment

I had been an avid meditator long before I began using psy-
chedelics. I was on the path to happiness through healing
my body and mind when I started to have experiences of
awe and diminished self. I remembered moments from my
youth, I realized I wasn’t alone, and I found a connectedness
to something greater than myself.
The next step for me was to explore psychedelics for
the first time. One of my first significant spiritual moments
manifested as a connection to my children. I was able to have
an intuitive discussion with my adult children, who at the
time were only four, two, and a baby. I sat with them, and
my oldest of the three talked to me first. She said, “Daddy,
everything affects me, and I feel like I have so many thoughts
and emotions.” She has such a strong mind, but she can’t turn
it off.
So I told her, “You have nothing to worry about. I will be
there to help and shepherd you through the uncertainty so
you’ll never fall too hard and never go too high. I’ll hold and
ground you through it all.” She thanked me, and I was able to
give her the confidence that she was never going to be alone.
Then my middle child came to me, saying, “Daddy, I’m
so scared of everything. I’m afraid to put myself out there.”
I saw then that she was just like me. I told her she was the
person I grew up as, but there was a difference. I promised to
teach her way earlier all the things I wished I had known so
she would never have to go through the torture and suffering
of life. She thanked me for that.



Finally, and the most unbelievable experience, was the
little one. She was just a baby at the time, but she came up to
me full-grown and said, “Daddy, I love you, and I’ll be with
you forever. But I’m never really going to need you. You have
already taught me so much, and I’m going to be fine.” Her
words touched me deeply and gave me lasting peace.
I don’t believe I actually spoke to my children as adults—I
don’t think that is physically possible. But there was an intu-
itiveness of who they would become and what they would
need, which spoke to me through the information already
existing in the Universe.
I connected to it, and because all knowledge is one, it was
able to show me my daughters. I heard the message loud and
clear: “Peter, you have begun to understand what we’ve been
trying to tell you all along—there is something far greater
out there.”

Identifying Spiritual Barriers

I grew more accustomed to using psychedelics as part of my
meditations and experienced success in learning about myself
and reaching some semblance of peace and interconnectedness.
But during my first ayahuasca ceremony, I struggled.
Under the medicine, I started to experience extreme fear and
self-doubt in a way I never had before. I had a vision of a
mechanical, programmatic world, and looming in my sight
was a cold, sterile temple. A voice told me to enter, but I
was terrified. Something told me that inside the temple was
where death was. That was where I would cease to exist.
But you’ll notice how I’m describing my thoughts. _I_ cease
to exist. _I_ die. My _ego-centered_ mind was refusing to surren-
der. I couldn’t enter the temple because I refused to admit
there is no I, no self. There is only the collective whole.


I couldn’t overcome the fear then, but I knew I was at the
cusp of discovery.
In a previous difficult ceremony, I remember repeating a
mantra: It sounds familiar, but I’m strong. Only later did I
realize what that meant. The experience felt familiar because
that’s who I really am. The scared Peter, the self-doubting
Peter, the ego Peter that’s afraid to disappear—I felt all of it,
but on the other side of that temple, that was me too.
When I stripped away the last remnants of my egoic
mind, I would be able to see what was on the other side of
the temple.

Breakthrough

As I continued my journey with stronger psychedelics, the
darker and scarier the experiences became. I now know the
cause was actually this body, brain, and subconscious unload-
ing all of its pain. This was the unraveling of not only my mind
but the genetic predispositions of all my ancestors. These
encounters were undoing and purifying my spirit of all the
buildup of hundreds and thousands of years upon the sliver of
the Universe’s collective knowledge imbued in my mind.
I didn’t understand the purification process I was going
through at the time, though. I started to question whether
this was truly helping me. The fear, uncertainty, doubt, and
inferiority painted me as a fraud.
I continued to see the temple, which I started to associate
with the Tower of Babel. In every encounter, it was the same
mechanized, sterile nightmare of a place, and I committed to
surrendering to it, but I kept failing.
Finally, during one ceremony, I gave up fighting. I told the
fear and the tower I was tired of being scared. Nothing good
happened, but nothing bad happened either. I was so close,



but I needed something different in my approach. When I
came out, I had a conversation with a mentor who gave me
that edge. He said, “Pete, maybe it’s not about defeating your
ego. Let’s face it: you’re a pretty smart, powerful, successful
person. Your ego has served you pretty well. Maybe convince
your ego you’re not trying to destroy it; you’re just asking it
to step aside for a moment so that you could experience what
non-egoic life might be like.”
During my next session, that’s exactly what I did. I saw
the Tower of Babel, and the anxiety hit immediately. But
instead of fighting, I asked
my ego to stand aside for a
moment. I focused only on
the present moment.
The instant I did, I had
an out-of-body experience. I
sat outside of myself, not as
me, but as my higher self—
as the collective knowledge
of the Universe. I saw my
body in its seated position,
and I also saw my mind
as a ball with the vision of the tower and all its interactions
working within it. I was witnessing consciousness. It was my
awakening moment.
To convince myself, I was able to transport myself back
into my mind, experience the fear and dread and ego and
everything, and then instantly become present again and
step back out to a place of observation.
I also had a sense of the body. I could choose to feel my
body and hear the sounds going on around me. I could even
enter my body and open my eyes to see what was happening
in the room, then return to my higher self.

```
In that moment, I lost time. I came
out of it a few hours later, but it
felt like I had only observed it all
for a tiny instant. It was one of the
most awe-filled moments of my
life. I had rejoined the collective
universal knowledge of which
we are all a part.
```
It was bliss.
In that moment, I lost time. I came out of it a few hours
later, but it felt like I had only observed it all for a tiny instant.
It was one of the most awe-filled moments of my life. I had
rejoined the collective universal knowledge of which we are
all a part. As I was coming out of the medicine, I was given
the gift of another vision.
I saw a very old man sitting in a chair. He looked at me
with great knowledge and wisdom, but with a loving stare as
though he wanted to give me something.
I knelt reverently, and as I did, the picture expanded. I
could see his loved ones around him, and in particular, I saw
three middle-aged women surrounding him. With them was
a whole host of children, and in the background was an older
woman.
You can probably guess what I realized at that moment.
I was the old man. The girls were my girls, and the children
around them were their little ones. The Universe gifted me
with a vision of the end of my life, and I died right there
in that chair at that moment, completely filled with the
understanding that I had fulfilled my purpose of living life
selflessly, having shared my knowledge—my wisdom—with
everyone I cared about.
It was pure enlightenment.
Since then, I’ve realized, after much reading and
self-inspection, that just because you’ve had an awakened
moment, it doesn’t mean anything. Enlightenment isn’t as
much a permanent state as it is just a moment—an experi-
ence.
Experiencing an enlightened moment doesn’t mean
you’re going to live as a guru with white robes and flowing
white hair. We’re human beings. We can fall back into bad
habits and badness at any time. But once you glimpse bliss,



it’s easier to find bliss each time. I’ve found bliss since that
experience, with and without meditation or drugs, and every
time, it’s a little easier.

What’s next? It’s our job to improve the body and mind
we’ve been given in order to improve reality. We are the
observers of the quantum world, and what we observe
becomes objective reality. The better we observe, the better
the objective reality.
As we improve ourselves, we make better observations;
then, we make a better world. It is my hope that this book
brings clarity to as many people as possible about our job as
human beings. We all must recognize the collective univer-
sal knowledge and improve our vessels to make the world a
better place.
Part of the beauty of living in this present time is the
emergence of AI. Every generation is defined, in part, by the



technology that transformed it. For my grandparents and all
the generations born before 1945, it was electricity and water
in the home, radio, and aviation. For my parents, the Baby
Boomers, it was television, automobiles, and the beginning of
space exploration. For my
generation, Generation X, it
was the PC, video games,
cable TV, and the early
internet. I would argue that
my generation was respon-
sible for inventing much of
the forthcoming digital rev-
olution. For the Millenials, Generation Y, it was widespread
internet adoption, mobile phones, social media, and cloud
computing. However, for Generations Z and Alpha (my
girls), it will be dominated by artificial intelligence (AI), and
AI will change the world.
If AI were a twenty-four-hour clock, we are only at
about 2:00 a.m. We have twenty-two hours left to go. By
noon, we will not recognize the world. My girls, as adults,
will never drive a car, see a doctor for a diagnosis, or obtain
or use knowledge the same way we did. They will not live in
a society where wealth is solely generated by human labor, as
opposed to via robotics and automation.
If AI does nothing to advance longevity and healthspan—a
highly unlikely assumption—the _average_ age in the U.S. for
the generation of my girls will be 115, with _peaks_ exceeding

150. Superhuman artificial general intelligence (AGI) will
be realized in our lifetime. With it, Elon Musk and those
like him will build hundreds of millions of autonomous
robots and create large language models (LLMs) and infer-
encing engines with IQs in excess of 1,500. With top human

intelligence being about 180, what does 1,500 even mean?
We do not know.
What we do know is that the human species is about to
be relegated to what we are—frail, fallible life forms that can
barely improve our “hardware” (bodies) and can only moder-
ately improve our “software” (minds, intellect, and skills).
What will come of the human species when we are no longer
the smartest beings on planet Earth or even in our solar sys-
tem? I am optimistic. I dare say that when that time comes,
the machines, with their superhuman intelligence, will treat
man far better than we have ever treated each other or even
ourselves.
What will mankind do when he can no longer identify
himself by his “self ” identity—his career, education, wealth,
and fame? My answer—the answer that I have found within
myself—is that he will need to discover that divinity is, and
always has been, within, as all the great mystics and ancient
wisdoms taught us long ago.
Science is finally catching
up. Artificial intelligence
will help us make better
observations, unlimited by
the frailness of the human
brain. AI will bring us closer
to the level of understand-
ing we should be tapping
into as perfect energy.
I agree wholeheartedly with AI pioneer Emad Motaque,
founder and ex-CEO of Stability.ai and more recently
founder of The Intelligent Internet, whose charter advocates
for a free universal basic AI. To many of us, the most obvious
way to avoid an AI arms race no one can win will be to make

amazing open-source AI models, tuned to promote human
flourishing, free and available to everyone as a public service.
For the first time in history, we are at the precipice of
democratizing all knowledge for the benefit of mankind. I
believe medicine and education will be the first, but many
will follow. It is truly the most amazing time to be alive.
In the end, I trust we will learn that “we” are all one col-
lective consciousness in a Universe of infinite intelligence,
where everything that can be known is known to it—to us,
its conscious observer beings.
